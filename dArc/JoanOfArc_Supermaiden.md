### The Pope's Song

THE POPE

Joan, I am ecstatic to meet you face to face.
You've been getting sainthood all over your case.
Leading armies, hearing voices from the skies.
And now some claim you're God-sent,
That I must canonize.

So, you are the Maid, you're the famed Joan of Arc.
Operate the change of fate; anoint yourself a monarch.
Do this simple feat, make the skeptics retreat.
Come on, Maid of Orléans.

Joan, you can't conceive the stir you've made in Rome.
You're on everyone's lips, from pauper to the dome.
What a tale if it turns out false, my dear.
But I believe you could sway the critics, have no fear.

So, you are the Maid, you're the famed Joan of Arc.
Show to me you're Heaven's tool; walk unburned through fiery fuel.
If you pass through the flame, we'll revere your holy name.
Come on, Maid of Orléans.

I ask as would be posed to any saint-to-be,
What gift from God has placed you where the world can see?
I am watching, as the Church's guiding hand.
Awaiting proof that you're apart from those in normy band.

So, if you are the Maid, the proclaimed Joan of Arc,
Feed the souls with your deeds, heal world hunger and all needs.
Or are tales all gone wrong? Joan, why make us wait so long?
Come on, Maid of Orléans.

Hey! Church Militant scares you, Joan?
Oh, Venerable Joan of Arc?
You're trademark, not a saint.
Proof is what we want, not quaint.

Keep her away,
Next audience: next century!
Speak no more, Joan of,
Silence, Joan of,
Quiet, Saint Venerable Blessed Joan of Arc!
Leave my records!
Your standard is no more, Joan,
Exit from our sight.


## Jesus, Jesus, I'll burn!

JOAN

I only wish to say,
If there’s a way,
Keep the flames away from me,
For I am weaker than this torment.
Feel it burn me,
I have changed.
Once I heard voices, clear and sparkling.

Then, I was chosen.
Now, I’m trapped and poisoned.
Listen, surely I've met Heaven's expectations,
Fought one long year, seemed like twenty.
Has Jesus asked as much from any other soul?
But if I burn,
See my path through and keep my standard true,
Let them mock me, scorn me, chain me, tie me to the flames.
I want to know, I want to know, dear Jesus,
Want to know, I want to know, good Jesus,
Want to see, I want to see, dear Saints,
Want to see, I want to see, dear Saints,
Why I must burn.
Will my name shine brighter than it ever has before?
Will all the hearts which moved beat same drum evermore?
I need to know, I need to know, dear Jesus,
Need to know, I need to know, good Jesus,
Need to see, I need to see, dear Saints,
Need to see, I need to see, good Saints,
If I am ash what will then be my crown?
If I am ash what will then be my crown?
Need to know, I need to know, dear Jesus,
I need to know, I need to know, good Jesus,
Why must I burn? Oh, why must I burn?
Can you tell me now my dust won't be forgotten?
Show me just a fragment of your grand celestial plane.
Show me there's a reason for my toils and pain.
You've chosen me for grilling and tasked Rouen for embers.
Alright, I'll burn!
Just watch me burn!
See how I burn!
Oh oh oh oh
Yeah
See how I burn!

Back then I was chosen,
Now, I'm trapped and poisoned.
After all, I've tried for one year, seems like always.
Angel Michael, for The Throne, your white standard I've flown
In Rouen's fiery dawn, I'll burn for Christ, alone.
Heaven, your purpose is vast,
But in you, my trust is cast.
I'll wear your garb, accept my past.
Take me to your stake, Rouen.
Burn me, light me,
End me.
Take me, now!
Before my heart gives up.
