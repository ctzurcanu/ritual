Jeanne rode outside the walls of the city and visited all of the English boulevards surrounding it. Staying beyond the range of the besiegers' weapons, she was able to evaluate her opponents' fortified positions and troop strength.
Later that evening she retired to the Church of Sainte-Croix in Orléans and offered prayers for the fulfillment of her task.

1429-05-04: Wednesday, Orléans. Jeanne confronts Dunois. The Saint-Loup bastide is taken.
Leading reinforcements he had found at Blois, the Bastard of Orléans returned to his besieged city.
Dismayed at the French military leaders' unwillingness to believe that the English at Orléans were vulnerable, as she did, but having expressed her views forcefully, Joan retired to her lodgings to rest.
Jean d'Aulon: "After this conversation, I lay on a couch that was in the Maid's room to take a little rest, for I was tired and weary; and Joan lay down with her hostess on a bed also, to sleep and get some rest. But when I was beginning to doze, the Maid suddenly sprang out of bed and woke me with the great noise she made. And when I asked her what was the matter, she replied, "In God's name, my Counsel has told me that I must attack the English. But I do not know if I should go to their bastille or against Ffastolf, who is to revictual them." Thereupon I got up quickly and armed the Maid as quickly as I could." [...] "the Maid left the room without my knowledge and went out into the street, where she found a page on a horse. Immediately she made him dismount and quickly mounted the beast herself. Then as straight and as fast as she could, she made her way right to the Burgundy gate? where the greatest noise came from." [...] "we made our way to a very strong enemy bastille called the Saint Loup bastille, which was immediately attacked by the French and carried by assault with very few losses. All the enemy in it were killed or made prisoner, and the bastille remained in French hands."

The English in the Saint Loup boulevard put up a 'very strong resistance, because the English, who were very well fortified, defended it very valiantly for the space of three hours'. Most fought until they were killed. In the end, however, the French did succeed in conquering the isolated English stronghold, despite an attempted relief expedition from the boulevard of Saint Pouër; 140 English soldiers were killed, with 40 more taken as prisoners.

Jean Pasquerel testified that even though she wept for the slain English soldiers, as they had died without confession, she also promised boldly 'that within five days the siege being waged before Orléans would be raised and no English would remain in front of the city'.

1429-05-05: Thursday, Orléans. Ascension Day: no combat. Jeanne sends the English an ultimatum. St. Jean le Blanc bastille taken.

Jeanne in a letter to the English: 
"You, Englishmen, who have no right to this kingdom of France, the King of Heaven orders and commands you through me, Joan the Maid, to leave your fortresses and return to your country, or I shall make such an uproar that will be in constant memory. And these things I write to you for the third and last time; I will write no further. Thus signed: Jhesus-Maria, Joan the Maid.

PS:
I have sent to you my letters honestly, but you have detained my messengers, in French, my heralds, for you have kept my herald named Guyenne. Would you send him to me, and I will send to you some of your men captured in the fortress of Saint Loup, because all of them were not killed."

Jeanne and her troops crossed over to one of the islands in the river - the name of the island is not given by either Aulon or Coutes but was probably the Ile aux Boeufs or the Ile aux Toiles - and there commandeer two boats to use as a bridge to the English-held shore. The boulevard of Saint Jean le Blanc, was deserted, the English troops there having retreated into the boulevard of the Augustins or the Tourelles. Bloodless, it was a French victory nonetheless.

#WinOrleans
[Orléans, France](location)

1429-05-06: Friday, Orléans. Bastide of the Augustinians taken.

[The Maid] sallied out of Orléans in the company of the Bastard of Orléans, the marshals of Sainte-Sévère and de Rais, the lord of Graville, Sir Florent d'Illiers, La Hire, and many other knights and squires, and around four thousand soldiers. And they crossed the Loire river between Saint Loup and the Tour Neuve ... And then the English sallied out of the Tourelles in great strength, shouting loudly, and they made a charge against them which was very strong and harsh. But the Maid and La Hire, and all of their army, joined together and attacked the English with such great force and courage that they caused them to recoil all the way to their boulevard and the Tourelles. And then they delivered such an assault against the boulevard and bastille there which had earlier been fortified by the English in the place where the Church of the Augustins had once been, that they took it by force, freeing a large number of French who were held there as prisoners, and killing a large number of English who were inside and who had defended it most harshly, such that there had been many wonderful feats of arms, on one side and the other.

Jeanne when French leaders wanted to stop pressing the next day: 'You were in your council, and I was in mine; and you ought to believe that the counsel of my Lord will be done and will endure, and any other counsel will perish.' 
She then summoned Pasquerel and asked him to wake early, earlier than he had on this day, and to remain close to her, for 'tomorrow blood will flow from my body above my breast'.

#WinOrleans
[Orléans, France](location)

1429-05-07: Saturday, Orléans. Bastide of the Tourelles taken.
On the morning of 7 May, Jeanne arose early and prepared for battle as she had every other day during her sojourn in Orléans: she confessed to Jean Pasquerel and heard mass. She then roused her troops for the attack.

The Maid said to those who were with her: “By Saint Martin, I will take this today and return to the city over this bridge”

Count of Dunois (Bastard of Orléans): "[...] on May 7, early in the morn-ing, when the assault had begun on the enemy who were holding out beyond the bridge bulwark,' Joan was wounded by an arrow that penetrated her flesh between her neck and her shoulder for a depth of six inches.
Despite this, she did not retire from the battle and took no remedy against the wound. The assault went on from morning till eight o'clock in the evening, so that there was hardly any hope of victory that day. Therefore I was going to break off and intended the army to retire into the city. Then the Maid came up to me and requested me to wait a little longer. Thereupon she mounted her horse and herself retired into a vineyard at some distance from the crowd of men; and in that vineyard she remained at prayer for the space of eight minutes. When she came back, she immediately picked up her standard and took up her position on the edge of the ditch. The moment she was there the English trembled with terror; and the King's men regained their courage and began to climb, delivering their assault against the bulwark and not meeting with the least resistance. Then that bulwark was taken, and the English who were in it fled. But they were all killed, among the rest Classidas' and the other principal English captains of this bastille, who intended to retire into the bridge tower but fell in the river and were drowned. This Classidas had been the man who had spoken most foully and in the basest and most infamous language against the Maid. So the bastille was taken, and I returned, together with the Maid and the rest of the French, to the city of Orléans, where we were received with great transports of joy and thanksgiving. And Joan was taken to her lodging so that her wound might be dressed. Once the surgeon had done his work, she had her supper, eating four or five toasts soaked in wine heavily watered, and she had taken no other food or drink all that day."

Jean d'Aulon: "That same day I had heard the Maid say, "In God's name, tonight we shall enter the city over the bridge." And when they had done so, the Maid and her men retired into the city of Orléans, where I had her wounds tended, for she had been struck by an arrow during the assault."

Jean Pasquerel: “And then she . . . shouted, saying, 'Glasdale, Glasdale, give in, give in to the King of Heaven! You called me a whore. I have great pity for your and your men's souls.' Then Glasdale, armed from head to foot, fell into the Loire river and drowned.”

1429-05-08: Sunday, Orléans. The English raise the siege. Thanksgiving procession throughout the city.

Everyone was filled with a great joy and praised Our Lord for the great victory which he had given them. And well they should have done so, for it is said that this assault, which lasted from the morning all the way to sunset was so grandly fought and defended. It was one of the most beautiful feats of arms which had been done for a very long time... All of the clergy and the people of Orléans sang devoutly Te Deum laudamus, and all of the bells of the city were rung, very humbly thanking Our Lord... for his glorious divine relief. And there was great joy in all parts, giving wondrous praise to their brave defenders, and especially above all to Joan the Maid, who spent the night, with her lords, captains, and men-at-arms, on the battlefield, to guard the Tourelles which they had bravely“conquered, so that they might know whether the English on the side of Saint-Laurent wished to aid or avenge their companions. But they had no wish to do so.

Count of Dunois (Bastard of Orléans): "[...] in the early morning, the English left their tents and drew up in array for a battle. Whereupon Joan left her bed and put on only a light coat of mail, such as is known in French as a jasseran. However, she forbade anyone to go out against the English or to challenge them,but said that they must be allowed to retire; and they did retire unpursued, and from that hour the town was delivered from the enemy.

Throughout the kingdom, in fact, throughout Europe, Joan of Arc was recognized as the savior of Orléans.

Alain Chartier, end of July 1429: "This Maid, whom divine precept burns to satisfy, immediately asked him to give her an army to succor the Orléanais who were then in danger. He, to whom she showed no fear, at first denied her request, but finally conceded to it. This having been accepted, she took a huge amount of foodstuffs to Orléans. Crossing under the enemy camps, they perceived nothing hostile . . . Leaving the victuals in the city, and attacking these camps, which in a way was a miracle, in a short space of time she captured them, especially that which was erected almost in the middle of the bridge. It was so strong, so well armed with all types of weapons, and so fortified, that, if all people, if all nations fought against it, they could not capture it."

He then compares Joan to Hector, Alexander, Hannibal, and Caesar and ends:

"Here is she who seems not to come from anywhere on earth, who seems to be sent from the heaven to sustain with her neck and shoulders a fallen France. She raised the king out of the vast abyss on to the harbor and shore by laboring in storms and tempests, and she lifted up the spirits of the French to a greater hope. By restraining the ferocity of the English, she excited the bravery of the French, she prohibited the ruin of France, and she extinguished the fires of France. O singular virgin, worthy of all glory, worthy of all praise, worthy of divine honors! You are the honor of the reign, you are the light of the lily, you are the beauty, the glory, not only of France, but of all Christendom."

Count of Dunois (Bastard of Orléans): "[...]the English united all their forces. This made the French think that they were preparing to give battle. So they drew their own army up in battle array and made ready to receive the English attack. Then my lord the Duke of Alençon, in the presence of the lord constable," of myself, and of several others, asked Joan what should be done. She answered him loudly with the words, "See that you all have good spurs!" When those present heard this they asked her, "What did you say? Are we to turn our backs on them then?" "No," answered Joan, "it will be the English who will put up no defense. They will be beaten, and you will have to have good spurs to pursue them." And it was as she said. For they took to their heels, and they lost more than four thousand men in dead and prisoners."

Result: 2000 English dead vs. 3 French.

1429-11-04: Wednesday, Fall of Saint-Pierre-le-Moûtier.
Jean d'Aulon: "she answered that she was not alone, that she still had fifty thousand men in her com-pany, and that she would not leave that spot until she had taken the town.
At that moment, whatever she might say, she had not more than four or five men with her, which I know for certain, as do several others who also saw her. Therefore I told her out of hand to go away and retire like the rest.
She told me, however, to send for faggots and withies to form a bridge over the moat so that it might be possible to get near. And when she had said this she shouted out loudly, "Faggots and withies, everybody, so that we can make a bridge!" And they were immediately brought and put in position. The whole thing utterly astonished me, for the town was immediately carried by assault, and at that time there was no great resistance."

Guillaume Manchon: "Nearly every day, there were interrogations in the morning that lasted for about three or four hours. And sometimes they extracted difficult and subtle questions from what Joan had said and faced her with them after lunch in a second interrogation that lasted for two or three hours."
Jean Massieu: "When Joan was interrogated, there were six assessors with the judges, who put questions to her. And sometimes just when one of them was asking a question or she was replying to it, another would interrupt her; so much so that several times she said to her interrogators, "My dear lords, please take your turns!""

For this I was several times reprimanded by the said Benedicite, the promoter of the case. "What makes you so bold, wretch," he said to me, "as to let that excommunicated whore come near here without permission? I will have you put in a place where you will never see sun nor moon for a month if you do it again." And when the promoter saw that I did not obey him, he took up his stand several times before the chapel door; and Joan expressly asked,
"Is the Body of Jesus Christ here?""

Jean Massieu: "Also she most humbly begged all manner of people, of whatever condition or rank they might be, and whether of her party or of the other, for their pardon and asked them kindly to pray for her, at the same time pardoning them any harm they had done her. This she continued to do for a very long time, perhaps for half an hour, and until the end. The judges who were present, and even several of the English, were moved by this to great tears and weeping, and indeed they wept most bitterly. Some, and several of these same English, recognized God's hand and made professions of faith when they saw her make so remarkable an end. They were glad to have witnessed her end and said that she had been a good woman. When she was handed over by the Church, I remained with her, and she asked most fervently to be given a cross. And when an Englishman who was present heard this he made her a little one out of wood from the end of a stick, and handed it to her.
She received it and kissed it most devotedly, uttering pious lamentations and acknowledging God our Redeemer, who suffered for our redemption on the Cross, of which she had there the symbol and representation. Then she put that cross on her breast between her body and her clothes and humbly asked me to let her have the crucifix from the church so that she could gaze on it continuously until her death. And I saw to it that the clerk of the parish church of Saint Sauveur brought it to her. When it was brought, she embraced it closely and long and clung to it until she was tied to the stake."

Guillaume de la Chambre: "she uttered such pious lamentations and prayers that many wept. But some of the English laughed. I heard her say these words, or something like them: "Oh, Rouen, I am much afraid that you may suffer for my death." Then she began to cry, "Jesus!" and to invoke Saint Michael, and finally she was choked by the fire."

Pierre Cusquel: "After Joan's death, the English had her ashes collected and thrown into the Seine because they feared that she might escape, or that certain people might believe that she had done so."

Jean Massieu: "I heard from Jean Fleury, the bailiffs clerk and scribe, how the executioner had told him that when the body was burned in the flames and reduced to ashes her heart remained intact and full of blood. And he was told to collect her ashes and all that remained of her and throw them into the Seine, which he did."

Thomas Marie: "Many men told me that the name of Jesus had been seen written in the flames of the fire in which she was burned."

Isambart de la Pierre: "One of the English, a soldier who particularly loathed Joan and who had sworn to carry a faggot to her pyre with his own hand, was struck with a stupor or a kind of ecstasy when he was doing so and heard her crying on the name of Jesus in her last moments. He was taken to a tavern near the Vieux Marché to be restored to his senses with the aid of strong drink. And when he had eaten with a friar of the Dominican order, this Englishman confessed to the friar, who was an Englishman, that he had committed a grievous sin, and that he repented of what he had done against Joan, whom he considered a saint. For it seemed to this Englishman that he had seen a white dove flying from the direction of France at the moment when she was giving up the ghost. And the executioner,' after his midday meal on that same day, came to the Dominican convent and said to me that he greatly feared he was damned, for he had burned a saint."
