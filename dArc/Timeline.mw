Jeanne rode outside the walls of the city and visited all of the English boulevards surrounding it. Staying beyond the range of the besiegers' weapons, she was able to evaluate her opponents' fortified positions and troop strength.
Later that evening she retired to the Church of Sainte-Croix in Orléans and offered prayers for the fulfillment of her task.

1429-05-04: Wednesday, Orléans. Jeanne confronts Dunois. The Saint-Loup bastide is taken.
Leading reinforcements he had found at Blois, the Bastard of Orléans returned to his besieged city.
Dismayed at the French military leaders' unwillingness to believe that the English at Orléans were vulnerable, as she did, but having expressed her views forcefully, Joan retired to her lodgings to rest.
Jean d'Aulon: "After this conversation, I lay on a couch that was in the Maid's room to take a little rest, for I was tired and weary; and Joan lay down with her hostess on a bed also, to sleep and get some rest. But when I was beginning to doze, the Maid suddenly sprang out of bed and woke me with the great noise she made. And when I asked her what was the matter, she replied, "In God's name, my Counsel has told me that I must attack the English. But I do not know if I should go to their bastille or against Ffastolf, who is to revictual them." Thereupon I got up quickly and armed the Maid as quickly as I could." [...] "the Maid left the room without my knowledge and went out into the street, where she found a page on a horse. Immediately she made him dismount and quickly mounted the beast herself. Then as straight and as fast as she could, she made her way right to the Burgundy gate? where the greatest noise came from." [...] "we made our way to a very strong enemy bastille called the Saint Loup bastille, which was immediately attacked by the French and carried by assault with very few losses. All the enemy in it were killed or made prisoner, and the bastille remained in French hands."

The English in the Saint Loup boulevard put up a 'very strong resistance, because the English, who were very well fortified, defended it very valiantly for the space of three hours'. Most fought until they were killed. In the end, however, the French did succeed in conquering the isolated English stronghold, despite an attempted relief expedition from the boulevard of Saint Pouër; 140 English soldiers were killed, with 40 more taken as prisoners.

Jean Pasquerel testified that even though she wept for the slain English soldiers, as they had died without confession, she also promised boldly 'that within five days the siege being waged before Orléans would be raised and no English would remain in front of the city'.

1429-05-05: Thursday, Orléans. Ascension Day: no combat. Jeanne sends the English an ultimatum. St. Jean le Blanc bastille taken.

Jeanne in a letter to the English: 
"You, Englishmen, who have no right to this kingdom of France, the King of Heaven orders and commands you through me, Joan the Maid, to leave your fortresses and return to your country, or I shall make such an uproar that will be in constant memory. And these things I write to you for the third and last time; I will write no further. Thus signed: Jhesus-Maria, Joan the Maid.

PS:
I have sent to you my letters honestly, but you have detained my messengers, in French, my heralds, for you have kept my herald named Guyenne. Would you send him to me, and I will send to you some of your men captured in the fortress of Saint Loup, because all of them were not killed."

Jeanne and her troops crossed over to one of the islands in the river - the name of the island is not given by either Aulon or Coutes but was probably the Ile aux Boeufs or the Ile aux Toiles - and there commandeer two boats to use as a bridge to the English-held shore. The boulevard of Saint Jean le Blanc, was deserted, the English troops there having retreated into the boulevard of the Augustins or the Tourelles. Bloodless, it was a French victory nonetheless.

#WinOrleans
[Orléans, France](location)

1429-05-06: Friday, Orléans. Bastide of the Augustinians taken.

[The Maid] sallied out of Orléans in the company of the Bastard of Orléans, the marshals of Sainte-Sévère and de Rais, the lord of Graville, Sir Florent d'Illiers, La Hire, and many other knights and squires, and around four thousand soldiers. And they crossed the Loire river between Saint Loup and the Tour Neuve ... And then the English sallied out of the Tourelles in great strength, shouting loudly, and they made a charge against them which was very strong and harsh. But the Maid and La Hire, and all of their army, joined together and attacked the English with such great force and courage that they caused them to recoil all the way to their boulevard and the Tourelles. And then they delivered such an assault against the boulevard and bastille there which had earlier been fortified by the English in the place where the Church of the Augustins had once been, that they took it by force, freeing a large number of French who were held there as prisoners, and killing a large number of English who were inside and who had defended it most harshly, such that there had been many wonderful feats of arms, on one side and the other.

Jeanne when French leaders wanted to stop pressing the next day: 'You were in your council, and I was in mine; and you ought to believe that the counsel of my Lord will be done and will endure, and any other counsel will perish.' 
She then summoned Pasquerel and asked him to wake early, earlier than he had on this day, and to remain close to her, for 'tomorrow blood will flow from my body above my breast'.

#WinOrleans
[Orléans, France](location)

1429-05-07: Saturday, Orléans. Bastide of the Tourelles taken.
On the morning of 7 May, Jeanne arose early and prepared for battle as she had every other day during her sojourn in Orléans: she confessed to Jean Pasquerel and heard mass. She then roused her troops for the attack.

The Maid said to those who were with her: “By Saint Martin, I will take this today and return to the city over this bridge”

Count of Dunois (Bastard of Orléans): "[...] on May 7, early in the morn-ing, when the assault had begun on the enemy who were holding out beyond the bridge bulwark,' Joan was wounded by an arrow that penetrated her flesh between her neck and her shoulder for a depth of six inches.
Despite this, she did not retire from the battle and took no remedy against the wound. The assault went on from morning till eight o'clock in the evening, so that there was hardly any hope of victory that day. Therefore I was going to break off and intended the army to retire into the city. Then the Maid came up to me and requested me to wait a little longer. Thereupon she mounted her horse and herself retired into a vineyard at some distance from the crowd of men; and in that vineyard she remained at prayer for the space of eight minutes. When she came back, she immediately picked up her standard and took up her position on the edge of the ditch. The moment she was there the English trembled with terror; and the King's men regained their courage and began to climb, delivering their assault against the bulwark and not meeting with the least resistance. Then that bulwark was taken, and the English who were in it fled. But they were all killed, among the rest Classidas' and the other principal English captains of this bastille, who intended to retire into the bridge tower but fell in the river and were drowned. This Classidas had been the man who had spoken most foully and in the basest and most infamous language against the Maid. So the bastille was taken, and I returned, together with the Maid and the rest of the French, to the city of Orléans, where we were received with great transports of joy and thanksgiving. And Joan was taken to her lodging so that her wound might be dressed. Once the surgeon had done his work, she had her supper, eating four or five toasts soaked in wine heavily watered, and she had taken no other food or drink all that day."

Jean d'Aulon: "That same day I had heard the Maid say, "In God's name, tonight we shall enter the city over the bridge." And when they had done so, the Maid and her men retired into the city of Orléans, where I had her wounds tended, for she had been struck by an arrow during the assault."

Jean Pasquerel: “And then she . . . shouted, saying, 'Glasdale, Glasdale, give in, give in to the King of Heaven! You called me a whore. I have great pity for your and your men's souls.' Then Glasdale, armed from head to foot, fell into the Loire river and drowned.”

1429-05-08: Sunday, Orléans. The English raise the siege. Thanksgiving procession throughout the city.

Everyone was filled with a great joy and praised Our Lord for the great victory which he had given them. And well they should have done so, for it is said that this assault, which lasted from the morning all the way to sunset was so grandly fought and defended. It was one of the most beautiful feats of arms which had been done for a very long time... All of the clergy and the people of Orléans sang devoutly Te Deum laudamus, and all of the bells of the city were rung, very humbly thanking Our Lord... for his glorious divine relief. And there was great joy in all parts, giving wondrous praise to their brave defenders, and especially above all to Joan the Maid, who spent the night, with her lords, captains, and men-at-arms, on the battlefield, to guard the Tourelles which they had bravely“conquered, so that they might know whether the English on the side of Saint-Laurent wished to aid or avenge their companions. But they had no wish to do so.

Count of Dunois (Bastard of Orléans): "[...] in the early morning, the English left their tents and drew up in array for a battle. Whereupon Joan left her bed and put on only a light coat of mail, such as is known in French as a jasseran. However, she forbade anyone to go out against the English or to challenge them,but said that they must be allowed to retire; and they did retire unpursued, and from that hour the town was delivered from the enemy.

Throughout the kingdom, in fact, throughout Europe, Joan of Arc was recognized as the savior of Orléans.

Alain Chartier, end of July 1429: "This Maid, whom divine precept burns to satisfy, immediately asked him to give her an army to succor the Orléanais who were then in danger. He, to whom she showed no fear, at first denied her request, but finally conceded to it. This having been accepted, she took a huge amount of foodstuffs to Orléans. Crossing under the enemy camps, they perceived nothing hostile . . . Leaving the victuals in the city, and attacking these camps, which in a way was a miracle, in a short space of time she captured them, especially that which was erected almost in the middle of the bridge. It was so strong, so well armed with all types of weapons, and so fortified, that, if all people, if all nations fought against it, they could not capture it."

He then compares Joan to Hector, Alexander, Hannibal, and Caesar and ends:

"Here is she who seems not to come from anywhere on earth, who seems to be sent from the heaven to sustain with her neck and shoulders a fallen France. She raised the king out of the vast abyss on to the harbor and shore by laboring in storms and tempests, and she lifted up the spirits of the French to a greater hope. By restraining the ferocity of the English, she excited the bravery of the French, she prohibited the ruin of France, and she extinguished the fires of France. O singular virgin, worthy of all glory, worthy of all praise, worthy of divine honors! You are the honor of the reign, you are the light of the lily, you are the beauty, the glory, not only of France, but of all Christendom."

1429-06-11: Saturday, Attack on Jargeau.
There was a debate between the captains, because some were of the opinion that they should attack the town, and others asserted to the contrary that the English were very powerful and were there in a large multitude.
Then Joan, seeing that there was this difficulty between them, said that they should not fear any multitude, nor have difficulty in attacking these English, because God was conducting their work. Joan said that unless she was sure that God was leading this work, she would have chosen to herd her sheep rather than expose herself to such dangers.

Jeanne: "Do not have doubts. When God pleases, the hour is ripe. We must act when God wills it. Act, and God will act." 
Jeanne to John of Alençon: "O gentle Duke, can you be afraid? Do you know that I have promised your wife to bring you back safe and sound?"
John of Alençon: "During the attack on the town of Jargeau, Joan told me at one moment to retire from the place where I was standing, for if I did not "that engine" —and she pointed to a piece of artillery in the town —"will kill you." I fell back, and a little later on that very spot where I had been standing someone by the name of my lord de Lude was killed."

1429-06-12: Sunday, Jargeau. Jargeau taken.

Jeanne: "Surrender this place to the King of Heaven and to the gentle King Charles, and you can go, otherwise you will be massacred"

This speech was followed by an intensive gunpowder bombardment from the French positions across the river and in the suburbs, echoed, to a lesser extent, by the English, who it seems had fewer of these weapons.24 The French guns began to batter the walls of Jargeau; in particular, writes the anonymous author of the Journal du siège d’Orléans, one bombard from Orléans, named Bergerie or Bergière, brought down one of the larger of the town’s towers.

Jeanne said to John of Alençon: ‘Forward, gentle duke, to the assault!’ And since it seemed to him that it was premature for them to undertake an attack so quickly, Jeanne said to him: ‘Do not doubt! The time is right when it pleases God. And one ought to act when God wishes. Act and God will act.”

John of Alençon: "And with the soldiers breaking in . . . Joan was on a ladder, holding her standard in her hands, when the standard was struck, and Joan also was struck on top of her head with a stone which broke on her helmet. She was knocked to the ground, and when she arose, she said to the soldiers: ‘Friends, friends, up! up! Our Lord has condemned the English. At this hour they are ours. Have courage! [...] and in a short time, the town of Jargeau was taken."

That night celebrations were held in both Jargeau and Orléans.

They attacked the bridge of Meung-sur-Loire, which the English had fortified and garrisoned with brave men, who defended it well. But notwithstanding their defense, it was taken by simple assault, without hardly interrupting them from their way to Beaugency.
The French left a large garrison of their own soldiers on the bridge.

1429-06-17: Friday, Beaugency castle taken.

When the English force commanded by Fastolf appeared:
Jeanne:  ‘Go and camp for today, because it is quite late. But tomorrow, at the pleasure of God and Our Lady, we will look more closely at you.’ Then the English lords who were not going to fight departed from this place and rode to Meung where they lodged that night. They would not return next day.

Eventually, no assault was needed to capture Beaugency. The continual bombardment of the town’s fortifications – although there is an indication that Joan was running out of gunpowder64 – the disparity between English numbers and those of the attacking army, and the inability or unwillingness of Fastolf’s relief force to fight a battle against the French forces there, led Guestin and Gough to negotiate for peace. The English would surrender the town in exchange for the promise of safe-conduct for themselves, their horses and harness, and any moveable goods, ‘so long as they were not valued at more than one mark of silver’. They also promised not to fight against the French for the following ten days (which Joan must have estimated would take them out of the conflict for Meung-sur-Loire; as it was, it also kept them from participating in the battle of Patay). Surrender terms were accepted, and Beaugency once again became French.

1429-06-18: Saturday, Battle of Patay. 
Jeanne: "In the name of God, let us go to fight them! If they were hung in the clouds, we would get them, for God sent them to us that we might punish them!"
Jeanne: “The gentle king will have today the greatest victory he has ever had. And my counsel has told me that they will all be ours.”

But then something unusual happened which foiled the English secrecy. Waurin writes:
"With much excitement came the French after their enemy, whom they could not see nor knew the place where they were, when, during the front-riders’ approach, they saw a stag run out of the woods, which made its way towards Patay and crashed into the formation of the English [archers]. These made a very loud cry, not knowing that their enemy was so near to them. Hearing this cry, the French front-riders were certain that there were the English, and also they saw them afterwards very plainly. So they sent some of their companions to notify their captains what they had seen and discovered, and they made known to them that they should ride forward in good order and that it was time to press on. Those [the captains] promptly prepared themselves in all things and rode so that they saw the English very clearly."

Count of Dunois (Bastard of Orléans): "[...]the English united all their forces. This made the French think that they were preparing to give battle. So they drew their own army up in battle array and made ready to receive the English attack. Then my lord the Duke of Alençon, in the presence of the lord constable," of myself, and of several others, asked Joan what should be done. She answered him loudly with the words, "See that you all have good spurs!" When those present heard this they asked her, "What did you say? Are we to turn our backs on them then?" "No," answered Joan, "it will be the English who will put up no defense. They will be beaten, and you will have to have good spurs to pursue them." And it was as she said. For they took to their heels, and they lost more than four thousand men in dead and prisoners."

By this time, the main body of the French army had ridden on to the field. The English forces were by then completely disordered as they all tried to flee. French infantry and cavalry charged on to these disordered troops and a slaughter ensued.

Result: 2200 English dead vs. 3 French.
Villages of Janville, Mehun, Ferté-Hubert, Montpeyroux, and Saint-Simeon surrendered to the French.

Gracious loyal Frenchmen of the city of Tournai, the Maid sends you the news that from here in eight days, whether by assault or otherwise, she has chased the English out of every place they held on the River Loire. Many of them are dead or taken prisoners and they are discomfited in battle. And may you well believe that the Earl of Suffolk, La Pole his brother, the Lord Talbot, the lord of Scales, and my lord John Fastolf, and many knights and captains have been taken, and that the brother of the Earl of Suffolk and Glasdale are dead. Hold yourselves fast, loyal Frenchmen, I pray you.

And I pray and demand that you be ready to come to the anointing of the gracious King Charles at Reims, where we shall soon be; come before us when you hear that we are approaching. I commend you to God; may God keep watch over you and give you grace to be able to sustain the good cause of the kingdom of France."

  Very good and dear friends – lords, townsmen, and residents of the city of Troyes – Joan the Maid commands and informs you on behalf of the King of Heaven our rightful and sovereign Lord, in whose royal service she serves daily, that you should truly obey and recognize the gracious king of France, who will soon be at the city of Reims and at Paris, come who may against him. And with the aid of the King Jesus he will be in all good cities in his holy kingdom. Loyal Frenchmen, come before King Charles. Do not fail to do so; have no hesitation about your lives and property if you do so. And if you do not do so, I promise and assure you for your lives’ sake that with God’s aid we shall enter all the cities that should belong to the holy Kingdom; and we will establish a firm peace there, whoever comes against us. I commend you to God, may God protect you, if it please Him. Reply soon.”

“Joan came and entered Charles' council, saying these or similar words: ‘Noble dauphin, order your people to come and besiege the town of Troyes, and stay no longer in council. For, in the name of God, before three days are out, I will lead you into the city of Troyes, by love or strength or courage, and the false Burgundians will be amazed.”

Jeanne was put in charge of the siege. She began quickly. First, she set up all of the French gunpowder artillery against the walls and prepared for its use. Then she ordered her soldiers to make bundles of sticks in order to fill in the moat around the town. All of this was done in sight of the Troyennes.
The citizens of Troyes, fearing any attack, sent to negotiate a surrender with the king.

As they approached the Reims, the dauphin began to worry that it, deep in Burgundian territory, might choose to hold out against him.

Joan said to the king: ‘Do not doubt, as the burgesses of the town of Reims will come to meet with you.’ But the king feared the resistence of those of Reims because they did not have artillery . . . nor machines to place in siege, if they were to rebel. And Joan told the king that he ought to proceed boldly and not doubt, because, if he proceeded strongly, he would obtain his entire kingdom.

Joan was correct, Simon Charles concluded, for even 'before they approached Reims, the burgesses had surrendered to him'

1429-07-17: Sunday, Anointing of Charles VII in the cathedral of Reims.

The English had tried to strip the cathedral of its liturgical vestments and vessels. They had not been able to do so completely and had left behind the most important and sacred vial of oil – which had been secreted away by monks loyal to the dauphin – traditionally used for the consecration of French kings since Clovis. Four knights had been appointed as guardians of this vial: the marshal de Boussac, the Admiral of France, the lord of Graville, and Gilles de Rais. All had been present in numerous of Joan’s victories.

During coronation Jeanne was by the king’s side, dressed in her armor and carrying her standard. (Later, at her trial when she was asked why she had carried her standard during the coronation, she answered: ‘It had suffered for this; there was good reason that it had this honor').

When the Maid saw that the king had been consecrated and crowned, she knelt before him, in front of all of the lords standing around them, and she embraced his legs, saying as she cried warm tears: ‘Gentle king, the pleasure of God has been executed. He Who wished that I relieve the siege of Orléans, and Who brought you into this city of Reims to receive your holy consecration, demonstrated that you are the true king and the one to whom the kingdom should belong.

Jeanne writes to Burgundy:
“Jhesus Maria

  High and dread prince, duke of Burgundy, the Maid calls upon you by the King of Heaven, my rightful and sovereign Lord, to make a firm and lasting peace with the king of France. You two must pardon one another fully with a sincere heart, as loyal Christians should; and if it pleases you to make war, go and wage it on the Saracens. Prince of Burgundy, I pray you, supplicate, and humbly request rather than require you, make war no more on the holy kingdom of France. Withdraw at once and swiftly those of your men who are in certain places and fortresses of the aforesaid holy kingdom. As for the gentle king of France, he is ready to make peace with you, saving his honor, if it has to do with you alone. And I must make known to you from the King of Heaven, my rightful and sovereign Lord, for your good and for your honor and upon your life, that you will win no more battles against loyal Frenchmen and that all those who wage war against the aforesaid holy kingdom of France are warring against King Jesus, “King of Heaven and of all earth, my rightful and sovereign Lord. And I pray you and call upon you with hands joined not to seek any battle nor war against us, neither you nor your men nor subjects, and believe firmly that no number of men that you bring against us will win, and that there will be great pity for the battle and the bloodshed there of those who come against us."

Letter of Jeanne to the inhabitants of Reims.
“My dear and good friends, the good and loyal Frenchmen of the city of Reims, Joan the Maid sends you her news, and begs and requires you to have no doubt about the good fight she is waging for the blood royal. I promise and certify that I shall never abandon you as long as I shall live. And it is true that the king has made a truce with the duke of Burgundy for a period of fifteen days, by which the duke will surrender the city of Paris to him peacefully at the end of those fifteen days. Nevertheless, you should not wonder at seeing me not enter that city so swiftly. No matter how many truces are made, I am never content and do not know if I will keep them. But if I do, it will be only to preserve the King’s honor. No matter how much they mock the blood royal, I shall hold the King’s army and keep it together lest, at the end of those fifteen days, they do not make peace. On that account, my dear and perfect friends, I beg you not to grieve yourselves about this as long as I shall live, but I do require that you keep good watch and guard the king’s good city. Let me know if there are any traitors who would do you grief. Briefly, I shall do all I can to combat them; let me know your news. I commend you to God; may He protect you."

Rene of Anjou, the duke of Bar, joined the French army. He was a welcome addition, one which Joan had asked for when she visited his father-in-law, Charles, the duke of Lorraine, before she left Vaucouleurs.

The English army was closer to the town, about half a league away, with a slightly larger army, 8,000–9,000 combatants, including, again according to Monstrelet, 600–800 Burgundians.

The dean of the Collegiate Church in Metz reports that La Trémoïlle spoke against such a venture, but that the king allowed Joan to go anyway.

Perceval de Cagny: "When the king found himself at Compiègne, the Maid was very saddened by the sojourn which he wished to make. And it seemed by this that he was content with what the grace of God had given him without attempting any other undertaking. She appealed to the duke of Alençon and said to him: ‘My fair duke, equip your men and those of the other captains. By my Martin, I want to go to see Paris from closer than I have ever seen it."

Unknown to Joan and her colleagues was the ambassadorial journey that was then being made to Philip the Good by Archbishop Regnault of Chartres and other French legates. At the very time that she was marching south to Paris, the archbishop was making offers to the duke of Burgundy that would certainly have angered the Maid. In reparation for the murder of the duke’s father, John the Fearless, for which Charles VII suddenly seems to have taken responsibility, and in order to keep the Burgundians out of the war which he intended to fight against the English, the king was willing to allow Philip to set his own requirements.

1429-09-08: Tuesday, Attack on Paris, at the Saint-Honoré Gate.

Around the Paris city walls was a moat, 3 meters deep and 32 meters in width in some places.
Saint-Honoré gate is known from archaeological excavations to have measured 18.5 meters by 8.34 meters – with angular towers, arrowslits, gunports, murder-holes, portcullises, and drawbridges built into them, their chambers capable of garrisoning a large number of soldiers. 

Perceval de Cagny: "The attack was hard and long, and it was a marvel to hear the sound and noise of the cannon and couleuvrines which those inside fired at those outside, and all manner of missiles in such a great multitude as to be innumerable. And although the Maid and a great number of knights, squires, and other soldiers had descended into the moat at the edge or around there, very few were wounded. And there were many on foot and on horse which were struck and knocked to the ground by blows from cannon stones, but by the grace of God and the presence of the Maid, not any man was killed or was wounded who was not able to return to his side and his tent without aid"

And after sunset, the Maid was struck by a crossbow bolt in the thigh. And since she was so struck, she forced herself to cry more strongly that each man should approach the walls and that they should take that place. But because it was night and she was wounded and the men-at-arms were fatigued from the long assault which they had made, the lord of Gaucourt and others came and took the Maid, and, against her will, they took her out of the moat. And thus the assault ended. And she had very great regret to have thus departed, saying ‘by my Martin, the place should have been taken’. They put her on her horse and took her to her tent in La Chapelle.

She had taken this from a Burgundian knight whom she defeated at Paris. Later, she testified that it was placed in the church ‘in devotion, as was the custom among men of arms when they are wounded. And because she was wounded before the town of Paris, she offered it to Saint-Denis, because that is the war-cry of France.

1429-11-04: Wednesday, Fall of Saint-Pierre-le-Moûtier.

Saint-Pierre-le-Moûtier was surrounded by a wall, with a deep moat, six flanking towers, and three fortified gates, all of which had been augmented and repaired in 1421. It was controlled by the leader of a free company, mercenary, Perrinet Gressart. He also controlled La Charite.

La Trémoïlle had been captured by Gressart as he traveled to La Charité to negotiate with the mercenary captain. To gain his freedom, La Trémoïlle was forced to pay a ransom of 14,000 écus.

Jean d'Aulon: "She answered that she was not alone, that she still had fifty thousand men in her company, and that she would not leave that spot until she had taken the town.
At that moment, whatever she might say, she had not more than four or five men with her, which I know for certain, as do several others who also saw her. Therefore I told her out of hand to go away and retire like the rest.
She told me, however, to send for faggots and withies to form a bridge over the moat so that it might be possible to get near. And when she had said this she shouted out loudly, "Faggots and withies, everybody, so that we can make a bridge!" And they were immediately brought and put in position. The whole thing utterly astonished me, for the town was immediately carried by assault, and at that time there was no great resistance."

But, because of the great quantities of gunpowder, arrows, and other equipment of war that were expended before the said town, and “because the lords who are in this town and I are so poorly provided to besiege La Charité, where we are going presently, I beseech you, that as you love the good and honor of the king and also those others here, that you would instantly send help for this siege, of gunpowder, saltpeter, sulphur, arrows, heavy crossbows, and other equipment of war. And do this so that, for lack of the said powder and other equipment of war, the situation will not be prolonged, and that you will not be said to be neglectful or rejecting. Dear and good friends, may Our Lord watch over you. Written at Moulins on the ninth day of November.

1429-11-24: Tuesday. At the request of Charles d'Albret, the inhabitants of Bourges sent 1,300 gold ecus to the royal troops. The siege begins shortly before this date and lasts a month.

No one in Charles’s court seems to have remembered to send Joan’s army more. Bows without arrows, crossbows without bolts, and cannons without gunpowder or cannonballs were useless, especially against a strongly fortified and well-stocked town filled with soldiers who were not likely to surrender unless forced and who were led by a captain whose capture meant certain execution. Such was Joan’s next target, La Charité-sur-Loire. In desperation, both Albret and Joan sent letters to nearby towns asking for whatever assistance could be granted them.

Because the king had not paid to send victuals or money to maintain the army there, they decided to lift the siege and departed in great displeasure’. Asked about the defeat at her trial, ‘why had she not entered the town of La Charité, after she had a commandment from God to do so’, Joan was indignant in her answer: ‘Who said to you that I had a commandment from God to do so?’ Later she testified ‘that she wished to go into France, but that the men of arms told her that it was better to go first against the town of La Charité.

1430-03-28: Letter to Hussites

Jeanne: Letter to Hussites: "Jesus-Maria

  For some time now, rumor and public information have reported to me, Joan the Maid, that from true Christians you have become heretics and that, like the Saracens, you have destroyed true religion and worship; embracing a shameful and criminal superstition and wishing to protect and propagate it, there is no shameful deed or belief you do not dare. You ruin the sacraments of the Church, you rend the articles of Faith, you destroy churches, you smash and burn the statues which have been erected as memorable monuments, you massacre Christians simply because they have kept the true Faith.

What is the frenzy? What rage or madness drives you? This Faith, which Almighty God, which is the Son, which the Holy Spirit have revealed, established, given sway and glorified a thousandfold through miracles is the faith which you persecute, which you wish to overturn and obliterate. You are blind, not because you lack foresight. Do you think that you will not be punished for this? Or do you not realize that God will block your criminal efforts? Do you think He will allow you to remain in darkness and error? The more you give yourselves over to “criminal sacrilege, the more He will ready great punishment and torment for you.

As for myself, I tell you frankly that if I were not kept busy with these English wars I would have come to see you a long time ago. But if I do not hear that you have corrected yourselves, I may well leave these English and set off against you, so that, by the sword if I cannot otherwise, I may remove your madness and foul superstition, taking either your heresy or your lives. But if you choose instead to return to the Catholic faith and to the original source of light, send me your ambassadors and I shall tell them what you must do. If you do not wish to do so and persist in resisting the spur, recall how much criminal harm you have done and wait for me, who will deal with you comparably with the aid of divine and human force."

If you want to know the real truth, this report said to him that there are many who are a part of a plot to betray the city and install the Burgundians. And since the king has learned that from you, it will not happen, and he is very pleased with you. Believe that you are high in his grace and that if you have to fight he will assist you in the event of any siege. He knows well that you have suffered much because of the hardships these treasonous Burgundian adversaries have imposed on you. So surrender yourselves to the will of God; rest assured that relief will be sent as soon as possible.

1430-03-29: Wednesday, Lagny-sur-Marne.

Perceval de Cagny: "When the king was in the town of Sully-sur-Loire, the Maid, who had seen and heard all the fact and the manner that the king and his council planned for the recovery of his kingdom, and being very irritated concerning that, found a means of departing from them. And without the knowledge of the king, and not taking leave from him, she seemed to be gone on some business, but, without returning, she went to the town of Lagny-sur-Marne [on the road to Compiègne], because those of that place were making good war against the English in Paris and elsewhere."

She was committing treason, and this may have been one of the reasons why Charles showed no desire to try to ransom her after her capture. She was in Lagny, dated there by the miracle of her restoring the life of a baby long enough for it to be baptized, thereby earning it the right to be buried in holy ground.


Joan heard of a detachment of Anglo-Burgundian soldiers, numbering between 300 and 400, who had ridden out of Paris towards the north and were passing not far outside of Lagny. They were commanded by a Burgundian, Franquet d’Arras.
The Maid charged down on these soldiers with about 400 men, ‘courageously and vigorously’, are the words Monstrelet uses. The Anglo-Burgundians withstood two attacks, but they could not withstand a third. Almost all were killed or captured. Joan herself took Arras prisoner; she kept the sword which he presented her at his surrender until she herself was caught.
She surrendered Arras to the townspeople of Senlis, who, with Joan’s consent, executed him for murder, theft, and treason. Her consenting to Arras’s execution would be used as evidence against her at her own trial a year later.

1430-05-22: Monday, Return to Compiégne.

During the night of 22/3 May, she discovered that the town had been surrounded by Burgundian and English troops. According to Perceval de Cagny, Joan was forced to sneak into Compiègne without arousing the Anglo-Burgundians. This she accomplished successfully:

  Although her men said that she had few soldiers to pass through the army of the Burgundians and the English, she said: ‘By my Martin, we are enough. I wish to see my good friends in Compiègne.’ She arrived there about sunrise and without confusion nor disturbance from either herself or her men, they entered the town.

1430-05-23: Tuesday, Capture of Jeanne d'Arc before Compiégne. Philip the Good comes from Coudun to Margny to see Jeanne.

Without sleep, "And around nine o’clock in the morning, the Maid heard that a large and forceful skirmish was being fought on the meadows outside of town [at Margny]. She armed herself and had her men arm themselves. They mounted their horses, and went out to join in the mêlée"

Georges Chastellain: "She mounted her horse, armed as would a man, and adorned in a doublet of rich cloth-of-gold over her armor. She rode a grey steed, very handsome and very proud, and displayed herself in the armor and manners that a captain who led a large army would. And in that state, with her standard raised high and blowing in the wind, and accompanied by many noble men, around four hours before midday, she charged out of the town."

Asked at her trial ‘whether she had a voice tell her to leave’ from Compiègne, she answered that ‘on that day she did not know beforehand of her capture, nor did she have any order to leave. But it always had been said to her that she would become a prisoner.'

Or in the evening of 24th.

Guillaume Manchon: "Nearly every day, there were interrogations in the morning that lasted for about three or four hours. And sometimes they extracted difficult and subtle questions from what Joan had said and faced her with them after lunch in a second interrogation that lasted for two or three hours."
Jean Massieu: "When Joan was interrogated, there were six assessors with the judges, who put questions to her. And sometimes just when one of them was asking a question or she was replying to it, another would interrupt her; so much so that several times she said to her interrogators, "My dear lords, please take your turns!""

Jean Massieu: "As, in leading Joan from her prison to her place of trial, I several times passed the castle chapel, I let her, at her request, stop there and say her prayers. For this I was several times reprimanded by the said Benedicite, the promoter of the case. "What makes you so bold, wretch," he said to me, "as to let that excommunicated whore come near here without permission? I will have you put in a place where you will never see sun nor moon for a month if you do it again." And when the promoter saw that I did not obey him, he took up his stand several times before the chapel door; and Joan expressly asked,
"Is the Body of Jesus Christ here?""

Jean Massieu: "Also she most humbly begged all manner of people, of whatever condition or rank they might be, and whether of her party or of the other, for their pardon and asked them kindly to pray for her, at the same time pardoning them any harm they had done her. This she continued to do for a very long time, perhaps for half an hour, and until the end. The judges who were present, and even several of the English, were moved by this to great tears and weeping, and indeed they wept most bitterly. Some, and several of these same English, recognized God's hand and made professions of faith when they saw her make so remarkable an end. They were glad to have witnessed her end and said that she had been a good woman. When she was handed over by the Church, I remained with her, and she asked most fervently to be given a cross. And when an Englishman who was present heard this he made her a little one out of wood from the end of a stick, and handed it to her.
She received it and kissed it most devotedly, uttering pious lamentations and acknowledging God our Redeemer, who suffered for our redemption on the Cross, of which she had there the symbol and representation. Then she put that cross on her breast between her body and her clothes and humbly asked me to let her have the crucifix from the church so that she could gaze on it continuously until her death. And I saw to it that the clerk of the parish church of Saint Sauveur brought it to her. When it was brought, she embraced it closely and long and clung to it until she was tied to the stake."

Guillaume de la Chambre: "she uttered such pious lamentations and prayers that many wept. But some of the English laughed. I heard her say these words, or something like them: "Oh, Rouen, I am much afraid that you may suffer for my death." Then she began to cry, "Jesus!" and to invoke Saint Michael, and finally she was choked by the fire."

Pierre Cusquel: "After Joan's death, the English had her ashes collected and thrown into the Seine because they feared that she might escape, or that certain people might believe that she had done so."

Jean Massieu: "I heard from Jean Fleury, the bailiffs clerk and scribe, how the executioner had told him that when the body was burned in the flames and reduced to ashes her heart remained intact and full of blood. And he was told to collect her ashes and all that remained of her and throw them into the Seine, which he did."

Thomas Marie: "Many men told me that the name of Jesus had been seen written in the flames of the fire in which she was burned."

Isambart de la Pierre: "One of the English, a soldier who particularly loathed Joan and who had sworn to carry a faggot to her pyre with his own hand, was struck with a stupor or a kind of ecstasy when he was doing so and heard her crying on the name of Jesus in her last moments. He was taken to a tavern near the Vieux Marché to be restored to his senses with the aid of strong drink. And when he had eaten with a friar of the Dominican order, this Englishman confessed to the friar, who was an Englishman, that he had committed a grievous sin, and that he repented of what he had done against Joan, whom he considered a saint. For it seemed to this Englishman that he had seen a white dove flying from the direction of France at the moment when she was giving up the ghost. And the executioner,' after his midday meal on that same day, came to the Dominican convent and said to me that he greatly feared he was damned, for he had burned a saint."
