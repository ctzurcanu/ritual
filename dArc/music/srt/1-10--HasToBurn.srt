1
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:09,890
[CHURCH ACTOR ONE:] Most Reverend Cauchon

2
00:37:10,270 --> 00:37:13,060
the courtroom waits your grace

3
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:16,360
The theologians

4
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:19,490
and clerics are here for the case

5
00:37:20,490 --> 00:37:22,910
[CAUCHON:]Ah gentlemen

6
00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:25,700
you know our task in Rouen

7
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:29,200
We've not much time

8
00:37:29,250 --> 00:37:32,210
and big ask from Paris, London, Rome

9
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:36,460
[FOLLOWERS:] Vive la Vierge Jeanne! Long live Supermaiden!

10
00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:38,630
Vive la Pucelle! Our Savioress!

11
00:37:38,710 --> 00:37:40,840
Vive la Vierge Jeanne! Long live Supermaiden!

12
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:42,930
Vive la Pucelle! Our Savioress!

13
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:45,970
[D'ESTIVET:] Listen to that clamor

14
00:37:46,050 --> 00:37:48,520
of peasants in the street

15
00:37:49,810 --> 00:37:51,810
A maid lifts up a banner

16
00:37:51,890 --> 00:37:54,520
and they fall at her feet

17
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:58,530
[COURTROOM:] She is dangerous!

18
00:37:58,570 --> 00:38:02,780
[FOLLOWERS:] Joan of Arc, Our Savioress!

19
00:38:02,950 --> 00:38:06,200
[COURTROOM:] She is dangerous!

20
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:09,080
[FOLLOWERS:] Tell us that you are
who we say that you are

21
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:11,200
[CHURCH ACTOR TWO:] The Maid is in the tower

22
00:38:11,250 --> 00:38:13,410
she will appear in court

23
00:38:14,170 --> 00:38:16,840
[CHURCH ACTOR THREE:] A rabble-rousing mission

24
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:19,590
we are tasked to abort

25
00:38:19,750 --> 00:38:22,260
[COURTROOM:] She is dangerous!

26
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:24,800
[FOLLOWERS:] Joan of Arc,

27
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:27,600
Our Savioress!

28
00:38:27,890 --> 00:38:31,600
[COURTROOM:] She is dangerous!

29
00:38:33,940 --> 00:38:36,810
[CHURCH ACTOR TWO:] Your Excellency, she steps right outside our yard

30
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:40,110
[CHURCH ACTOR THREE:] Most Reverend Cauchon, let in her English vanguard

31
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:41,780
[CAUCHON:] No, wait!

32
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:49,120
We need a more lasting solution
to any presumed plebiscite

33
00:38:49,950 --> 00:38:53,450
[D'ESTIVET:] What then to do about this Joan of Arc?

34
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:56,750
Peasant supermaid, heroine of fools.

35
00:38:56,790 --> 00:38:58,420
[CHURCH ACTOR THREE:] No riots, no armies,

36
00:38:58,460 --> 00:39:00,500
no credo, no sainting

37
00:39:00,590 --> 00:39:03,590
[CAUCHON:] One thing I'll say —- this Joan's not that bad

38
00:39:03,970 --> 00:39:07,340
[D'ESTIVET:] We dare not leave her to her own devices,

39
00:39:07,430 --> 00:39:10,930
Her misguided armies will soon get out of hand.

40
00:39:10,970 --> 00:39:12,430
[COURTROOM:] But how can we stop her?

41
00:39:12,470 --> 00:39:14,020
Her glamour increases,

42
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:15,810
She’s capturing cities;

43
00:39:15,850 --> 00:39:17,690
she's topping the trends.

44
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:21,400
[CAUCHON:] I see bad things arising

45
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:25,030
The crowd-crowned queen,
the Word Order would ban

46
00:39:25,110 --> 00:39:28,320
I see blood and rebranding

47
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:31,990
Our jobs outsourced because of one girl

48
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:35,000
Blood and rebranding because of one girl

49
00:39:35,290 --> 00:39:38,920
[COURTROOM:] Because, because, because of one girl

50
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:42,130
[CAUCHON:] Our elimination because of one girl

51
00:39:42,170 --> 00:39:45,090
[COURTROOM:] Because, because, because of one

52
00:39:45,170 --> 00:39:47,510
Cause of one, cause of one girl

53
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:51,010
[CHURCH ACTOR THREE:] What then to do about this Joan mania?

54
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:54,600
[D'ESTIVET:] Now how do we deal
with a shepherdess queen?

55
00:39:54,810 --> 00:39:57,770
[CHURCH ACTOR TWO:] Where do we start
with a Maiden bigger

56
00:39:57,850 --> 00:40:01,360
[CHURCH ACTOR THREE:] Than even Charles was
when Charles was still the VI-th?

57
00:40:01,650 --> 00:40:05,150
[CAUCHON:] Fools, you have no perception!

58
00:40:05,570 --> 00:40:08,490
The stakes we are gambling
are frighteningly high!

59
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:12,200
We must burn her completely,

60
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:15,160
Like Charles VI before her,
this Joan of Arc must die.

61
00:40:15,620 --> 00:40:18,670
For the sake of our Mother,
Catholic Church, no relics.

62
00:40:18,870 --> 00:40:22,670
[COURTROOM:] Must die, must burn, this Joan must burn.

63
00:40:22,710 --> 00:40:25,710
[CAUCHON:] Like Charles before Charles, this Joan has to die.

64
00:40:26,050 --> 00:40:30,130
[COURTROOM:] We must burn her completely, this Maiden must burn to thin dust!

65
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:31,970
She must burn completely,

66
00:40:32,220 --> 00:40:37,730
no proof of her being to everlast!
