00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:04,650
[1805]
[NAPOLEON:] I dreamed I met a maid from France

2
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:08,110
A most inspiring soul

3
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:10,860
She had that look

4
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:13,450
You seldom see

5
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:18,540
The fearless, yet restrained

6
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:22,410
I asked her

7
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,040
what compelled her be

8
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:27,840
How her story begun

9
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,340
I questioned her

10
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:33,930
she said no word

11
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:38,930
As if in other world

12
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:42,520
And next

13
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,730
The room was full

14
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:48,730
of stern and armored men

15
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:53,320
They seemed in awe of her

16
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:56,620
They knelt and then

17
00:05:57,530 --> 00:06:00,120
They vanished once again

18
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,040
Then I saw

19
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:05,920
Then I saw legions upon legions

20
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:08,880
Cheering for this one maid

21
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:11,710
And then I heard them

22
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:14,550
chant my name

23
00:06:14,611 --> 00:06:16,555
As if our fates

24
00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:19,720
were braid

25
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,610
[FOLLOWERS:]  Vive l'Empereur! 

26
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:29,610
[THE POPE:]  Vivat imperator in aeternum!
