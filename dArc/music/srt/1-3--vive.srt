Hey Jeanne, Vive Jeanne!

00:06:51,450 --> 00:06:54,490
Hey Joan, Joan

4
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:57,540
won't you lead us on?

5
00:06:57,580 --> 00:07:02,590
Jeanne, Vive Jeanne!
Vive La Pucelle d'Orléans!

6
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:06,420
[CAUCHON:] Tell your followers to be silent

7
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:08,760
we foresee a threat quite violent

8
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:11,470
This common host

9
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:14,470
has much too boast

10
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:18,350
Tell these fans who sing your praise

11
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:21,610
that they are fools and out of phase

12
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:23,440
They're not on the course

13
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:26,650
the Church will likely endorse

Hey Jeanne, Vive Jeanne!

00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:42,630
Hey Joan, Joan,

17
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:45,460
you're a Saint, or Saint-to-be!

18
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:51,050
Jeanne, Vive Jeanne!
Hey Maid of Orléans!

19
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:56,390
[JOAN:] Why squander your words rebuking my fans?

20
00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:02,150
If you stop their tongues,

21
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:05,230
beware of their hands

22
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,860
If tongues and hands were stilled

23
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:11,360
The sky and land themselves

24
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:15,330
Would start to sing

25

Hey Joan, Joan,

28
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:33,010
Won't you win for France?

29
00:08:33,050 --> 00:08:38,350
Jeanne, Vive Jeanne, Hey Maid of Orléans!

30
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:43,900
[JOAN:] Sing me your hymns,
But not just for me, do sing.

31
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,730
Sing out for all France,

32
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:49,940
For you are blessed

33
00:08:50,650 --> 00:08:52,610
There is not one here

34
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:55,700
Who cannot win a soul

35
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:58,490
The meek, the brave,

36
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:03,830
The toiling and the giving.

37
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:09,550

Hey Joan, Joan,

40
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:22,520
won't you burn for me?

41
00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:29,070
Jeanne, Vive Jeanne, Hey Maid of Orléans!
