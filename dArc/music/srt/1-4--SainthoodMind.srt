1
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:30,000
[role of: KING CHARLES VII]

2
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
My mind is clearer now,

3
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:40,000
At last all too well
I can see

4
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
where France
will soon be.

5
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:52,000
If you strip away 
the myth from the maid,

6
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:59,000
You will see where 
we all soon will be.

7
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Joan! You've started to believe
The things they say of you.

8
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:14,000
You really do believe
This voice of Saints is true. Oh!

9
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,000
And all the good you've done
Will soon get swept away.

10
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:27,000
You've begun to matter more
Than voices you obey.

11
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Listen Joan, I don't like what I see.
All I ask is that you listen to me.

12
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Et n'oubliez pas, je suis ton roi!

13
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:51,000
You have kindled their zeitgeist.

14
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
They think they've found another Christ.

15
00:09:54,000 --> 00:11:00,000
And they'll hurt you 
if they'll find they're wrong.

16
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I remember when 
ton histoire began.

17
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,000
No talk of saints then, 
you were une paysanne.

18
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Et crois-moi, 
mon promotion pour toi 
est non encore incinéré.

19
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:23,000
But every word you say today
Gets twisted 'round some other way.

20
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:28,000
And they'll hurt you 
if they think you've lied.

21
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Domrémy, your famous daughter 
should have stayed une anonyme

22
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Like her father tending sheep, 
she'd have made good.

23
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Fields, farms, and rural charms 
would have suited Joan best.

24
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
She'd have caused no alarms; 
nobody would be distressed.

25
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Listen, Joan, do you care for our France?

26
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Bestow to peace a diplomatic chance.

27
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:58,000
We are English-occupied; 
Our logistics are under-supplied.

28
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I am frightened by your clout.
Peasants are getting much too flout.

29
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:14,000
And they'll crush us if they win a war.
If they win any war...

30
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Listen, Joan, to the warning I give.
Please know that I want us to convive.

31
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:43,000
But it's sad to see our bond 
weakening with every city that you bomb.

32
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:49,000
All your followers are blind,
Too much sainthood on their minds.

33
00:12:49,000 --> 00:13:00,000
It was beautiful, but now it's tense.
Yes, it's all gone dangerously tense.

34
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Oh oh oh oh oh 
Yes, it's all gone dangerous.

35
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Listen, Joan, to the warning I give.
Please know that I want you to live.

36
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Allons y,
But she won't listen to me...

37
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Allons y!
She won't listen to me...
