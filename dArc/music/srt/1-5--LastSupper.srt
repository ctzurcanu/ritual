1
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:58,640
[FOLLOWERS:] Look at
all my trials and tribulations

2
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:05,270
Sinking in a gentle pool of wine

3
00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:10,240
Don't disturb me now

4
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:14,160
I can see the answers

5
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:18,080
Till this evening is this morning

6
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:21,250
Life is fine

7
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:29,840
Always hoped that I'd be of service

8
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:37,350
Knew that I would earn it if I tried

9
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:42,180
Then when we retire

10
00:14:42,270 --> 00:14:45,940
we can chant of Orleans,

11
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:52,900
So they'll still talk about us et la France

12
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:02,290
[JOAN:] The end...

13
00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:08,460
Is just a little harder

14
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,920
When brought about

15
00:15:14,130 --> 00:15:16,130
By our liege.

16
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:27,650
For all you care

17
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:35,280
your deeds could be my blood.

18
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:43,330
For all you care

19
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:47,500
your gifts to each other

20
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:51,710
could be my body.

21
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:00,850
The end!

22
00:16:01,930 --> 00:16:04,600
It is my blood you act.

23
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:09,520
It is my body you give.

24
00:16:10,810 --> 00:16:15,190
If you would, remember me

25
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:21,370
when you serve and donate

26
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:37,930
I must be mad, thinking I'll be remembered

27
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:40,840
Yes, I must be out of my head!

28
00:16:42,390 --> 00:16:44,470
Look at your blank faces

29
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,640
My name will mean nothing

30
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:48,980
Ten minutes after I'm dead!

31
00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:52,060
The Church denies me

32
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:53,610
One of you betrays me

33
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:56,400
[FOLLOWERS:] No! No!

34
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:59,150
(TALKS INDISTINCTLY) Who would?! Impossible!

35
00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:02,910
[JOAN:] The Church will deny me in just a few days.

36
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:04,790
[THE PRIEST:] No, not me!

37
00:17:04,870 --> 00:17:06,540
[JOAN:] Three times will deny me

38
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:08,580
And that's not all I see

39
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:12,210
One of you here dining
One of France's chosen

40
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:14,000
Will move to betray me

41
00:17:14,090 --> 00:17:17,630
[KING CHARLES VII:] Cut out the dramatics!
You know very well who

42
00:17:17,710 --> 00:17:19,420
[JOAN:] Why don't you go do it?

43
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:21,300
[KING CHARLES VII:] You want me to do it!

44
00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:23,300
[JOAN:] Hurry, the English are waiting

45
00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:25,060
[KING CHARLES VII:] If you knew why I do it

46
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:26,890
[JOAN:] I don't care why you do it!

47
00:17:26,930 --> 00:17:30,390
[KING CHARLES VII:] To think I admired you
Well, now I deny you

48
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:32,350
[JOAN:] You liar, you Judas

49
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:34,150
[KING CHARLES VII:] You wanted me to do it!

50
00:17:34,610 --> 00:17:38,110
What if I man and supply you again?
and ruined your ambition?

51
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:39,610
Christ, you deserve it!

52
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:42,280
[JOAN:] Hurry, you fool
Hurry and go

53
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:45,530
Save me your speeches
I don't want to know

54
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:48,500
Go! Go!

55
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:54,210
[FOLLOWERS:] Look at all my trials
and tribulations

56
00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:59,880
Sinking in a gentle pool of wine

57
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:03,220
What's that in the bread

58
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:06,010
It's gone to my head

59
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:09,220
Till this morning is this evening

60
00:18:09,310 --> 00:18:11,560
Life is fine

61
00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:18,480
Always hoped that I'd be of service.

62
00:18:19,150 --> 00:18:24,450
Knew that I would earn it if I tried.

63
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:27,580
Then when we retire

64
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:30,540
we can chant of Orleans,

65
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:36,670
So they'll all talk
about us et la France.

66
00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:49,560
[KING CHARLES VII:] You sad, pathetic maid

67
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:51,640
see what you make me do,

68
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:54,020
We lost city of Paris

69
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:56,360
and all because of you

70
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:58,730
But the unkingly part of all

71
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:01,150
I need to turn you i

72
00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:03,320
Like a common criminal

73
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:05,860
Like the traitor you could be

74
00:19:05,910 --> 00:19:07,820
A Retired Victor

75
00:19:07,870 --> 00:19:09,870
A Victor baddly tired

76
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:14,040
Like a retired, tired, tired and retired, chef de guerre Ã  la retraite

77
00:19:14,210 --> 00:19:16,710
[JOAN:] Get out! They're waiting!

78
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:19,250
Get out!

79
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,510
They're waiting! Oh!

80
00:19:21,550 --> 00:19:23,550
English are waiting for you!

81
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:26,220
[KING CHARLES VII:] Every time I look at you

82
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:29,180
I don't understand

83
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:34,310
Why you let the things
you did get so out of hand

84
00:19:34,810 --> 00:19:37,350
You'd have managed better

85
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:40,360
if you'd follow what I planned

86
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,070
Oh

87
00:19:58,290 --> 00:20:03,630
[FOLLOWERS:] Always hoped that I'd be of service.

88
00:20:05,670 --> 00:20:10,180
Knew that I would earn it if I tried.

89
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:12,260
If I tried

90
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:19,440
Then when we retire, we can chant of Orleans,

91
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:23,940
So they'll still talk about us

92
00:20:24,610 --> 00:20:29,200
et la France.

93
00:20:32,870 --> 00:20:37,040
[JOAN:] Will no one pray with me?

94
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,130
Soldiers?

95
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,250
Priests?

96
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,050
Frenchmen?

97
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:49,970
Will none of you burn with me?

98
00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:53,810
Soldiers?

99
00:20:55,470 --> 00:20:56,770
Priests?

100
00:20:57,810 --> 00:20:59,520
Frenchmen?
