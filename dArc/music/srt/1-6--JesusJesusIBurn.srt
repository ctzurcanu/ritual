1
00:21:21,639 --> 00:21:28,460
[JOAN:] I only wish to say,

2
00:21:28,639 --> 00:21:32,460
If thereâ€™s a way,

3
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Keep the flames away from me,
For I am weaker than this torment.

4
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Feel it burn me,
I have changed.

5
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Once I heard voices, clear and sparkling.

6
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Then, I was chosen.
Now, Iâ€™m trapped and poisoned.

7
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Listen, surely I've met 
Heaven's expectations,

8
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Fought one long year, 
seemed like twenty.

9
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Has Jesus asked as much 
from any other soul?

10
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:39,000
But if I burn,
See my path through

11
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,000
and keep my standard true,

12
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Let them mock me, 
scorn me, chain me,

13
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,000
stake me to the flames.

14
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
I want to know, 
I want to know, dear Jesus,

15
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Want to know, 
I want to know, good Jesus,

16
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Want to see, 
I want to see, dear Saints,

17
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Want to see, 
I want to see, dear Saints,

18
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Why I must burn.

19
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Will my name shine brighter 
than it ever has before?

20
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Will all the hearts I moved 
beat same drum evermore?

21
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,000
I need to know, 
I need to know, dear Jesus,

22
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Need to know, 
I need to know, good Jesus,

23
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Need to see, 
I need to see, dear Saints,

24
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Need to see, 
I need to see, good Saints,

25
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:35,000
If I am ash 
what will then be my crown?

26
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
If I am ash 
what will then be my crown?

27
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Need to know, 
I need to know, dear Jesus,

28
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
I need to know, 
I need to know, good Jesus,

29
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,000
I need to know, 
I need to know, my God,

30
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Why must I burn? 
Oh, 
why must I burn?

31
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Can you tell me now 
my dust won't be forgotten?

32
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Show me just a fragment 
of your grand celestial plane.

33
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Show me there's a reason 
for my toils and pain.

34
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:19,000
You've chosen me for grilling 
and tasked Rouen for embers.

35
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Alright, 
I'll burn!

36
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Oh oh oh Just
Just watch me burn!

37
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:39,000
See
See how I burn!
Oh oh oh oh

38
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Yeah
See how I burn!

39
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Back then I was chosen,

40
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Now, I'm trapped and poisoned.

41
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:41,000
After all, 
I've tried for one year, 
seems like always.

42
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Angel Michael, for The Throne, 
your white standard I've flown

43
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:58,000
In Rouen's fiery dawn, 
I'll burn for Christ, 
alone.

44
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Heaven, your purpose is vast,

45
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:13,000
But in you, my trust is cast.

46
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:21,000
I'll wear your garb, 
accept my past.

47
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Take me to your stake, 
Rouen.

48
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Burn me, light me,
End me.

49
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Take me, now!

50
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:43,000
Before my heart gives up.
