1
00:27:03,450 --> 00:27:08,330
[CAUCHON:] We've been sitting on
the fence for far too long

2
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:13,710
[D'ESTIVET:] Why let her upset us?

3
00:27:14,290 --> 00:27:16,300
Cauchon, let her be

4
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:19,170
All those imbeciles will see

5
00:27:20,050 --> 00:27:21,630
She really doesn't matter

6
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,640
[CAUCHON:] Joan is important,

7
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,770
We've let her go her way before.

8
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:30,640
And while she starts the revolution

9
00:27:31,230 --> 00:27:33,310
We theorize and chatter

10
00:27:34,190 --> 00:27:39,780
[D'ESTIVET:] He's just another
scripture-thumping hack from Lorraine

11
00:27:40,570 --> 00:27:43,200
[CAUCHON:] The difference is they call her a Saint

12
00:27:43,530 --> 00:27:45,740
This difference frightens me!

13
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:47,490
What about the Church?

14
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:50,960
When they see a new Maid crowned,

15
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:54,040
Do you think they'll stand around

16
00:27:54,170 --> 00:27:56,500
Cheering and applauding?

17
00:27:57,340 --> 00:27:59,050
What about our cardinals?

18
00:28:00,130 --> 00:28:02,340
If they see we've lost our nerve

19
00:28:03,090 --> 00:28:05,510
Don't you think that they deserve

20
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:07,930
Something less challenging?

21
00:28:10,310 --> 00:28:12,690
[D'ESTIVET:] But followers got what they want

22
00:28:12,770 --> 00:28:15,690
They think so anyway

23
00:28:17,150 --> 00:28:19,690
If she's what they want

24
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:22,110
Why take their toy away?

25
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:25,360
She's a craze

26
00:28:25,910 --> 00:28:27,990
[CAUCHON:] Put yourself in my place

27
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:30,250
I can hardly step aside

28
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,160
Cannot let my hands be tied

29
00:28:33,790 --> 00:28:35,630
I am canon law and order

30
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:38,290
What about our priesthood?

31
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:41,260
Don't you see that we could fall

32
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:44,300
If we are to last at all?

33
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:46,760
We cannot be divided

34
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,390
[D'ESTIVET:] Then say so to the Clerics

35
00:28:50,010 --> 00:28:52,430
But don't rely on subtlety

36
00:28:53,230 --> 00:28:55,770
Let English scare them or they won't see

37
00:28:56,230 --> 00:28:58,190
[CAUCHON:] Then we are decided?

38
00:28:59,650 --> 00:29:01,570
[D'ESTIVET:] Then we are decided.
