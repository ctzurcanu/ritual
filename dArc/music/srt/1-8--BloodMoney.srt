00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:41,020
[CHARLES VII:] Now if I help you,
it matters that you see

2
00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:43,480
These sordid kind of things
are coming hard to me

3
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:46,400
It's taken me some time
to work out what to do

4
00:29:46,490 --> 00:29:48,990
I weighed the whole thing out
before I came to you

5
00:29:49,070 --> 00:29:51,660
I have no thought at all about my own reward

6
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:54,120
I really didn't come here of my own accord

7
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:57,370
Just don't say I'm

8
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:02,500
Damned for all time!

9
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:07,380
I came because I had to
I'm the one who saw

10
00:30:07,930 --> 00:30:10,300
Joan can't control it like she did before

11
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:12,850
And furthermore
I know that Joan thinks so too

12
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:15,770
Joan wouldn't mind that I was here with you

13
00:30:15,850 --> 00:30:18,440
I have no thought at all about my own reward

14
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:21,270
I really didn't come here of my own accord

15
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:23,940
Just don't say I'm

16
00:30:26,650 --> 00:30:29,320
Damned for all time!

17
00:30:37,370 --> 00:30:40,000
Burgundians, you're friends, worldly men and wise

18
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:42,460
Cauchon, my friend I know you sympathize

19
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:45,090
Why are we the prophets?
Why are we the ones?

20
00:30:45,170 --> 00:30:47,550
We see the sad solution
Know what must be done

21
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:50,390
I have no thought at all about my own reward

22
00:30:50,430 --> 00:30:53,140
I really didn't come here of my own accord

23
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:55,430
Just don't say I'm

24
00:30:55,810 --> 00:30:58,230
Damned

25
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:02,560
For all time!

26
00:31:03,730 --> 00:31:05,480
[BURGUNDIANS:] Cut the protesting

27
00:31:05,570 --> 00:31:07,440
Forget the excuses

28
00:31:07,530 --> 00:31:09,240
We want information

29
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:10,820
Get up off the floor

30
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:12,740
[CAUCHON:] We have the papers

31
00:31:12,780 --> 00:31:14,490
We need to arrest her

32
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:16,330
You know her movements

33
00:31:16,410 --> 00:31:17,910
We know the canon law

34
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,830
[BURGUNDIANS:] Your help in this matter
won't go unrewarded

35
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:25,170
[CAUCHON:] We'll pay you in silver cash on the nail

36
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:29,260
We just need to know
where the soldiers can find her

37
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:30,760
[BURGUNDIANS:] With no armies around her

38
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:32,140
Then we can't fail

39
00:31:32,470 --> 00:31:35,680
[CHARLES VII:] I don't want your blood money

40
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:39,730
[CAUCHON:] That doesn't matter,
our expenses are good

41
00:31:39,770 --> 00:31:42,770
[CHARLES VII:] I don't need your blood money

42
00:31:42,850 --> 00:31:46,440
[BURGUNDIANS:] But you might as well take it
We think that you should

43
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:50,450
[CAUCHON:] Think of the things
you can do with that money

44
00:31:50,490 --> 00:31:53,910
Choose any charity, give to the poor

45
00:31:53,950 --> 00:31:57,450
We've noted your motives
We've noted your feelings

46
00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:59,790
[CAUCHON:] This isn't blood money, it's a...

47
00:31:59,870 --> 00:32:00,910
[BURGUNDIANS:] A fee.

48
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:04,500
[CAUCHON:] A fee, nothing more

49
00:32:36,910 --> 00:32:40,580
[CHARLES VII:] On Tuesday morning

50
00:32:41,370 --> 00:32:46,040
You'll find her where you want her

51
00:32:50,170 --> 00:32:54,130
Far from her army

52
00:32:55,050 --> 00:32:59,180
tired, locked out of gates

53
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:02,730

55
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:12,240
[BURGUNDIANS:] Well done Sire

56
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:18,320
Good old Charles
