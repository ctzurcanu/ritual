1
00:44:35,260 --> 00:44:37,350
[JESUS:] Try not to get worried

2
00:44:37,430 --> 00:44:39,730
Try not to turn onto

3
00:44:39,770 --> 00:44:42,060
Problems that upset you

4
00:44:43,150 --> 00:44:46,190
Don't you know everything's all right?

5
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:48,320
Yes, everything's fine

6
00:44:48,780 --> 00:44:52,780
And we want you to sleep well tonight

7
00:44:53,070 --> 00:44:57,290
Let the world turn without you tonight

8
00:44:57,700 --> 00:45:02,750
If we try, we'll get by
so forget all about us tonight

9
00:45:02,790 --> 00:45:04,920
[FOLLOWERS:] Everything's all right, yes

10
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:07,000
Everything's all right, yes

11
00:45:07,090 --> 00:45:09,380
[JESUS:] Sleep and I shall soothe you

12
00:45:09,470 --> 00:45:11,680
Calm you and anoint you

13
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:14,890
Myrrh for your hot forehead

14
00:45:14,970 --> 00:45:17,970
Then you'll feel everything's all right

15
00:45:18,060 --> 00:45:20,180
Yes, everything's fine

16
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:24,690
And it's cool and the ointment's sweet

17
00:45:24,770 --> 00:45:29,110
For the fire in your head and feet

18
00:45:29,150 --> 00:45:31,490
Close your eyes, close your eyes

19
00:45:31,530 --> 00:45:34,200
Relax, think of light tonight

20
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:36,240
[FOLLOWERS:] Everything's all right, yes

21
00:45:36,330 --> 00:45:37,910
Everything's all right, yes

22
00:45:37,990 --> 00:45:39,250
[KING CHARLES VII:] Hey, Christ

23
00:45:39,330 --> 00:45:43,210
Your fine ointment, brand-new and exquisite

24
00:45:43,290 --> 00:45:46,790
Should have been saved for a king

25
00:45:47,380 --> 00:45:49,670
Why has it been wasted?

26
00:45:49,710 --> 00:45:52,170
We could have raised maybe

27
00:45:52,220 --> 00:45:55,680
300 silver pieces or more

28
00:45:56,510 --> 00:45:58,560
People who are important

29
00:45:58,970 --> 00:46:01,180
People who are of might

30
00:46:01,230 --> 00:46:04,810
They matter more than

31
00:46:05,270 --> 00:46:11,440
a paysanne's skin!

32
00:46:11,610 --> 00:46:13,700
[JESUS:] Try not to get worried

33
00:46:13,780 --> 00:46:16,120
Try not to turn onto

34
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:18,870
Problems that upset you

35
00:46:19,410 --> 00:46:23,040
[JESUS:] Don't you know everything's all right?
[FOLLOWERS:] All right, yes

36
00:46:23,080 --> 00:46:25,000
Everything's all right, yes

37
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:27,330
[JOAN:] Surely you're not saying

38
00:46:27,380 --> 00:46:29,590
We have been elected

39
00:46:29,670 --> 00:46:32,760
To lead kings against their will?

40
00:46:34,130 --> 00:46:38,510
There will be mad kings
always in power

41
00:46:38,550 --> 00:46:41,850
Look at the good things you've got!

42
00:46:42,850 --> 00:46:44,940
Think while you still have France

43
00:46:45,020 --> 00:46:47,520
Move while you still rule France

44
00:46:48,230 --> 00:46:51,570
You'll be lost and you'll be sad

45
00:46:52,570 --> 00:46:57,660
without a kingdom.

46
00:46:57,910 --> 00:47:00,240
[JESUS:] Sleep and I shall soothe you

47
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:02,450
Calm you and anoint you

48
00:47:02,540 --> 00:47:05,580
Myrrh for your hot forehead

49
00:47:05,620 --> 00:47:08,920
Then you'll feel everything's all right, yes

50
00:47:09,250 --> 00:47:11,050
Everything's fine

51
00:47:11,090 --> 00:47:15,090
And it's cool and the ointment's sweet

52
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:19,220
For the fire in your head and feet

53
00:47:19,720 --> 00:47:22,890
Close your eyes
Close your eyes and relax

54
00:47:22,930 --> 00:47:24,430
Think of light

55
00:47:24,560 --> 00:47:25,560
Tonight

56
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:27,230
[FOLLOWERS:] Close your eyes, close your eyes and relax

57
00:47:27,270 --> 00:47:28,400
Think of light

58
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:30,980
[JESUS:] Close your eyes, close your eyes and relax

59
00:47:31,070 --> 00:47:32,780
[FOLLOWERS:] Everything's all right, yes

60
00:47:32,820 --> 00:47:37,110
[JESUS:] Close your eyes, close your eyes and relax
[FOLLOWERS:] Everything's all right, yes

61
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:41,280

[FOLLOWERS:] Everything's all right, yes

63
00:47:45,790 --> 00:47:49,960
[JESUS:] Close your eyes, close your eyes and relax
[FOLLOWERS:] Everything's all right, yes

64
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:54,130
[JESUS:] Close your eyes, close your eyes and relax
[FOLLOWERS:] Everything's all right, yes

65
00:47:54,210 --> 00:47:58,430
[JESUS:] Close your eyes, close your eyes and relax
[FOLLOWERS:] Everything's all right, yes

66
00:47:58,470 --> 00:48:02,760
[JESUS:] Close your eyes, close your eyes and relax
[FOLLOWERS:] Everything's all right, yes

67
00:48:02,810 --> 00:48:06,980
[JESUS:] Close your eyes, close your eyes and relax
[FOLLOWERS:] Everything's all right, yes

68
00:48:07,020 --> 00:48:11,150
[JESUS:] Close your eyes, close your eyes and relax
[FOLLOWERS:] Everything's all right, yes

69
00:48:11,230 --> 00:48:15,610
[JESUS:] Close your eyes, close your eyes and relax
[FOLLOWERS:] Everything's a light, yes

70
00:48:15,650 --> 00:48:17,860
Close your eyes, close your eyes and relax
Everything's all light, yes

71
00:48:17,860 --> 00:48:22,410
Everything's PURE LIGHT, yes
