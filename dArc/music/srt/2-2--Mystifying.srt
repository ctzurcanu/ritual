1
00:48:37,130 --> 00:48:40,010
[KING CHARLES VII:] It seems to me a strange thing

2
00:48:41,260 --> 00:48:43,140
Mystifying

3
00:48:43,850 --> 00:48:47,810
That a Christ like you bestows his light

4
00:48:48,560 --> 00:48:50,890
On a lowly paysanne like her

5
00:48:51,480 --> 00:48:53,150
[LA HIRE] Hey, cool it, king.

6
00:48:53,690 --> 00:48:56,400
[KING CHARLES VII:] Yes, I can understand that

7
00:48:56,900 --> 00:48:59,740
She is a hero

8
00:49:00,190 --> 00:49:04,490
But to let her hear you and your saints

9
00:49:04,990 --> 00:49:07,540
That's hardly in your line

10
00:49:08,040 --> 00:49:11,330
It's not that I object to her toils

11
00:49:12,710 --> 00:49:16,340
But she doesn't fit in well
with what your Church teaches

12
00:49:16,380 --> 00:49:19,840
It doesn't help us if the Church is inconsistent

13
00:49:20,590 --> 00:49:22,880
The English only need a small excuse

14
00:49:23,180 --> 00:49:24,840
To make all world theirs

15
00:49:25,550 --> 00:49:27,890
[JESUS CHRIST:] Who are you to criticize her?

16
00:49:27,970 --> 00:49:30,020
Who are you to despise her?

17
00:49:30,060 --> 00:49:32,020
Leave her, leave her
Let her be now

18
00:49:32,060 --> 00:49:34,270
Leave her, leave her
She's with me now

19
00:49:34,350 --> 00:49:37,520
If your slate is clean
then you can throw stones

20
00:49:37,610 --> 00:49:40,940
If your slate is not, then leave her alone!

21
00:49:45,700 --> 00:49:46,990
[FOLLOWERS:] Hey, Jesus, what do we say?

22
00:49:47,030 --> 00:49:48,950
-Hey, Jesus, what do we say?
-(CLAMORING)

23
00:49:56,170 --> 00:49:58,460
[JESUS CHRIST:] I'm amazed that you influencers

24
00:49:58,540 --> 00:50:01,380
Can be so shallow, thick and slow

25
00:50:01,420 --> 00:50:05,260
There is not a soul among you
who knows or cares where I come or go

26
00:50:05,720 --> 00:50:07,890
[FOLLOWERS:] No, you're wrong
You're very wrong

27
00:50:07,970 --> 00:50:10,140
No, you're wrong
You're very wrong

28
00:50:10,220 --> 00:50:12,430
No, you're wrong
You're very wrong

29
00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:14,890
No, you're wrong
You're very wrong

30
00:50:14,940 --> 00:50:16,560
How can you say that?

31
00:50:16,600 --> 00:50:18,270
How can you say that?

32
00:50:18,360 --> 00:50:19,730
How can you say that?

33
00:50:20,070 --> 00:50:21,900
How can you say that?

34
00:50:22,190 --> 00:50:23,240
[JESUS CHRIST:] Not one.

35
00:50:23,650 --> 00:50:25,280
[JESUS CHRIST:] Not one of you!
