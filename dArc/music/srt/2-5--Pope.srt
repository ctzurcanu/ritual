1
00:55:30,280 --> 00:55:31,740
Joan,

2
00:55:31,780 --> 00:55:33,990
I am extatic...

3
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:37,040
(SINGING)  To meet you face-to-face

4
00:55:37,830 --> 00:55:40,170
You got signs of sainthood

5
00:55:40,250 --> 00:55:43,210
all around your case

6
00:55:44,250 --> 00:55:47,090
-Leading armies
-Ooh.

7
00:55:47,130 --> 00:55:49,260
Hearing voices from on-high

8
00:55:49,300 --> 00:55:50,720
(ALL GASP)

9
00:55:51,260 --> 00:55:54,310
And some claim you're God-sent

10
00:55:54,560 --> 00:55:55,890
-(GASPS)
-Mmm.

11
00:55:55,930 --> 00:55:57,640
-Huh?
-Mmm.

12
00:55:58,730 --> 00:56:02,110
THE POPE: (SINGING)
that I must canonize.

13
00:56:03,020 --> 00:56:05,070
So

14
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:07,030
So, you are the Maid

15
00:56:07,110 --> 00:56:09,450
you're the Church's SuperMaid

16
00:56:10,320 --> 00:56:12,530
Operate the change of fate; 

17
00:56:12,620 --> 00:56:14,740
anoint yourself a saint

18
00:56:14,780 --> 00:56:16,490
Perform this small feat

19
00:56:16,580 --> 00:56:18,910
make all skeptics retreat

20
00:56:20,040 --> 00:56:22,920
Come on, Supermaiden

21
00:56:24,250 --> 00:56:28,670
Joan, you can't conceive 
the stir you've made in Rome

22
00:56:29,260 --> 00:56:33,050
You're on everyone's lips, 
from pauper to the dome

23
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:34,640
Oh

24
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:38,060
What a tale if it turns out false, my dear

25
00:56:38,390 --> 00:56:43,060
But I believe 
you could sway the critics, have no fear

26
00:56:43,980 --> 00:56:45,980
So, you are the Maid, 

27
00:56:46,070 --> 00:56:48,610
you're Church's SuperMaid.

28
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:51,820
Show to me you're Heaven's tool; 

29
00:56:51,860 --> 00:56:53,620
walk unburned through fiery fuel

30
00:56:53,820 --> 00:56:55,490
-If you pass through the flame,
-CROWD: Whoo!

31
00:56:55,580 --> 00:56:58,330
-holy I will make your name
-CROWD: Whoo!

32
00:56:58,830 --> 00:57:01,960
Come on, Maid of OrlÃ©ans

33
00:57:21,850 --> 00:57:25,810
I ask you as I would of any saint-to-be

34
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:30,320
What gift from God was placed on you 
where all the world can see?

35
00:57:30,360 --> 00:57:31,530
Oh-oh-oh

36
00:57:31,570 --> 00:57:32,860
I am waiting

37
00:57:32,950 --> 00:57:35,200
as the Church's guiding hand

38
00:57:35,370 --> 00:57:39,540
Awaiting proof that you're apart 
from those in the normy band

39
00:57:41,620 --> 00:57:43,040
So, if you are the Maid

40
00:57:43,120 --> 00:57:45,670
the proclaimed Saint Joan

41
00:57:46,210 --> 00:57:48,630
Fill the github with your deeds

42
00:57:48,710 --> 00:57:50,380
heal world hunger and all needs

43
00:57:51,420 --> 00:57:55,300
Or are tales all gone wrong? 
Joan, why make us wait so long?

44
00:57:55,800 --> 00:57:58,720
Oh! Come on, you Supermaiden

45
00:58:00,100 --> 00:58:03,020
(SINGING)  Hey! Doesn't

46
00:58:03,060 --> 00:58:05,730
Church Triumphant scare you, Joan?

47
00:58:05,770 --> 00:58:09,520
Oh, Venerable Joan of Arc?

48
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:15,410
You're a trademark, not a saint.
Proof is what we want, not quaint.

49
00:58:15,490 --> 00:58:16,950
(SINGS)  Keep her away,

50
00:58:17,030 --> 00:58:19,580
Next audience: next century!

51
00:58:20,450 --> 00:58:22,450
Speak no more, Joan of,

52
00:58:22,750 --> 00:58:24,410
Silence, Joan of,

53
00:58:25,250 --> 00:58:27,710
Quiet, you Venerable Blessed Saint Joan of Arc!

54
00:58:29,420 --> 00:58:32,050
THE POPE: Leave our records!

55
00:58:33,420 --> 00:58:34,760
Your standard leads nowhere, Joan,

56
00:58:35,590 --> 00:58:37,680
Erase her from our archives!
