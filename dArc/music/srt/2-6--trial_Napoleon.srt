1
00:58:32,790 --> 00:58:35,250
[NAPOLEON:] And so the Queen

2
00:58:36,290 --> 00:58:39,090
Is once again my guest

3
00:58:40,250 --> 00:58:42,000
And why is this?

4
00:58:43,090 --> 00:58:45,840
Was The Pope unimpressed?

5
00:58:46,840 --> 00:58:49,180
[CAUCHON:] We turn to history

6
00:58:49,890 --> 00:58:52,390
To seal our judgement

7
00:58:54,140 --> 00:58:56,810
We have no way

8
00:58:57,650 --> 00:59:00,480
To pain her after death

9
00:59:03,650 --> 00:59:06,650
We need her totally forgotten

10
00:59:06,740 --> 00:59:09,320
It's all you have to do

11
00:59:09,820 --> 00:59:11,990
We need her erased from history

00:59:15,830 --> 00:59:19,580
[NAPOLEON:] Talk to me, Joan of Arc
You have been brought here

14
00:59:19,670 --> 00:59:23,000
Manacled, burned, by your own people.

15
00:59:23,090 --> 00:59:26,050
Do you have the first idea
why you deserved it?

16
00:59:26,420 --> 00:59:30,010
[NAPOLEON:] Listen Savioress of France,
Where are your saved?

17
00:59:30,090 --> 00:59:32,640
Look at me
Am I saved?

18
00:59:33,140 --> 00:59:35,140
[JOAN:] I have no savings

19
00:59:35,680 --> 00:59:37,690
In the world, I'm through.

20
00:59:38,350 --> 00:59:39,650
[FOLLOWERS:] Talk to me, Joan of Arc

21
00:59:39,690 --> 00:59:43,320
[JOAN:] There may be something saved for me somewhere.

22
00:59:43,690 --> 00:59:45,530
If you only knew.

23
00:59:47,200 --> 00:59:48,650
[NAPOLEON:] Then you are a savioress?

24
00:59:48,700 --> 00:59:50,070
[JOAN:] It's you who say I am

25
00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:53,080
I look for truth and find that I get grilled

26
00:59:53,160 --> 00:59:55,910
[NAPOLEON:] And what is truth?
Is truth unchanging law?

27
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,710
We both have truths
Are mine the same as yours?

28
00:59:58,750 --> 01:00:01,040
[FOLLOWERS:] Forget of her! Erase her deeds!

29
01:00:01,130 --> 01:00:04,000
[NAPOLEON:] What do you mean? You'd forget your savioress?

30
01:00:04,050 --> 01:00:06,010
[FOLLOWERS:] We have no savior but our own selves!

31
01:00:06,050 --> 01:00:08,970
[NAPOLEON:] She's done no wrong.
No, not the slightest thing.

32
01:00:09,180 --> 01:00:10,840
[FOLLOWERS:] We have no savior but our own selves!

33
01:00:10,890 --> 01:00:11,970
Erase her!

34
01:00:12,050 --> 01:00:15,060
[NAPOLEON:] What is this new respect for self?

35
01:00:15,100 --> 01:00:17,560
This looks imported from New Orleans.

36
01:00:17,640 --> 01:00:20,560
Who is this Saint? Why is she different?

37
01:00:20,770 --> 01:00:23,400
You choose bad leaders by the sackful.

38
01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:27,780
[FOLLOWERS:] We need her edited out,
It's all you have to do

01:00:27,860 --> 01:00:31,990
We need her erased,
It's all you have to do

01:00:32,740 --> 01:00:35,700
[NAPOLEON:] Talk to me, Joan of Arc

41
01:00:46,050 --> 01:00:48,380
Look at your Joan of Arc

42
01:00:48,420 --> 01:00:50,340
I'll agree she's mad

43
01:00:50,840 --> 01:00:52,760
Ought to be re-trialed

44
01:00:52,840 --> 01:00:55,560
But that is not a reason to erase her

45
01:00:56,260 --> 01:01:00,270
She's a sad, little girl, not a Savior or Christ

46
01:01:00,810 --> 01:01:03,650
Not even a liar, I need a crime!

47

[NAPOLEON:] You hypocrites,
you hate US more than her

53
01:01:21,660 --> 01:01:24,290
[FOLLOWERS:] We have no king but US!
Erase her!

[NAPOLEON:] I see no reason, I find no evil

55

This girl is harmless
so why does she upset you?

56
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:32,470
She's just misguided, thinks she's important

But to keep you vultures happy,
I shall edit her!
