1
01:05:31,670 --> 01:05:34,670
[JESUS CHRIST:] Close your eyes, close your eyes

2
01:05:34,750 --> 01:05:38,210
Look up into

3
01:05:38,300 --> 01:05:40,720
The Light

4
01:06:02,570 --> 01:06:08,740
I know how to lead her.

5
01:06:09,790 --> 01:06:11,210
What to do

6
01:06:11,580 --> 01:06:14,880
How to move her

7
01:06:14,960 --> 01:06:17,670
She's been changed

8
01:06:17,750 --> 01:06:21,090
Yes, really changed

9
01:06:21,670 --> 01:06:25,140
In these past few hundred years

10
01:06:25,180 --> 01:06:28,350
since she is here,

11
01:06:28,680 --> 01:06:35,190
She seems like someone else.

12
01:06:35,480 --> 01:06:42,360
I don't know how to take this

13
01:06:42,860 --> 01:06:47,870
I can see why she moves me

14
01:06:48,330 --> 01:06:50,740
She's a girl

15
01:06:51,200 --> 01:06:54,540
She's just a girl

16
01:06:54,870 --> 01:07:01,380
And I've led so many girl souls before,

17
01:07:01,840 --> 01:07:07,720
In very many ways

18
01:07:07,930 --> 01:07:11,600
She's just one more

19
01:07:13,060 --> 01:07:16,310
Should I bring her down

20
01:07:16,400 --> 01:07:19,730
Should I rise her up?

21
01:07:19,770 --> 01:07:23,150
Should I speak of might

22
01:07:23,240 --> 01:07:26,110
Let my Heavens light?

23
01:07:26,200 --> 01:07:32,240
I bent light come into her

24
01:07:33,250 --> 01:07:39,420
Will she see it inside?

25
01:07:42,550 --> 01:07:49,180
Don't ya think it's rather funny

26
01:07:50,050 --> 01:07:55,060
I should be in this position?

27
01:07:55,100 --> 01:07:57,440
I'm the one

28
01:07:58,060 --> 01:08:01,400
Who's always been

29
01:08:02,150 --> 01:08:06,200
So calm, so cool

30
01:08:06,570 --> 01:08:09,030
A model of God's tool

31
01:08:09,530 --> 01:08:14,620
Running the ageless show

32
01:08:15,450 --> 01:08:18,330
She loves me so

33
01:08:33,220 --> 01:08:35,470
I feel her true

34
01:08:35,560 --> 01:08:40,480
Now she's anew

35
01:08:41,150 --> 01:08:46,530
Her scars erased

36
01:08:50,700 --> 01:08:56,660
Her mission rebased

37
01:08:57,910 --> 01:08:59,710
Now she will see

38
01:08:59,790 --> 01:09:03,290
What she was meant

39
01:09:03,340 --> 01:09:05,460
To be

40
01:09:06,170 --> 01:09:08,550
What her burning

41
01:09:10,300 --> 01:09:13,680
Meant for me

42
01:09:14,810 --> 01:09:16,810
In my eternity

43
01:09:17,390 --> 01:09:22,650
In God's eternity

44
01:09:23,360 --> 01:09:26,190
She trusts me so

45
01:09:26,530 --> 01:09:29,530
I know her so

46
01:09:30,200 --> 01:09:34,200
I guide her

47
01:09:34,910 --> 01:09:40,290
Soul
