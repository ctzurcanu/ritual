1
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:30,000
[roles of: La Hire, Mercenaries]

2
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:16,000
[MERCENARIES:]
Joan, you know I love you.
Did you see my grin?

3
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:19,000
I believe in you and Christ,
So lead me to a win.

4
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:23,000
Joan, you know I love you.
Did you see my grin?

5
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:28,000
I believe in you and Christ,
So lead me to a win.

6
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:32,000
Joan, I am with you.
Guide me, guide me, Joan.

7
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:36,000
Joan, I fight for you.
Lead me, lead me, Joan.

8
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:41,000
[LA HIRE:]
Joan, what more do you need to convince you,
That you're our Leader and easily as strong

9
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:48,000
As the English who plunder our homeland,

10
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:53,000
And who've terrorized the Frenchmen for so long.

11
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:57,000
[MERCENARIES:]
Joan, I am with you.
Guide me, guide me, Joan.

12
01:11:57,000 --> 01:12:01,000
Joan, I fight for you.
Lead me, lead me, Joan.

13
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:05,000
Joan, you know I love you.
Did you see my grin?

14
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:09,000
I believe in you and Christ,
So lead me to a win.

15
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:16,000
Joan, I am with you.
Guide me, guide me, Joan.

16
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:17,000
Joan, I fight for you.
Lead me, lead me, Joan.

17
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:22,000
[LA HIRE:]
There must be legions upon legions
Screaming love and blood for you.

18
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:26,000
[MERCENARIES:]
Love! Love! Blood! Love!

19
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:31,000
[LA HIRE:]
And every man of all these legions
Would do whatever you ask him to.

20
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:35,000
[MERCENARIES:]
Anything you ask me to!

21
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:39,000
[LA HIRE:]
Keep them yelling their devotion,

22
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:43,000
But add a touch of hate of English band.

23
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:47,000
You will rise a greater standard,

24
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:51,000
We will win ourselves a land.

25
01:12:51,000 --> 01:13:16,000
You'll get the might and the light
For ever and ever and ever

26
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:31,000
You'll get the might and light,
you'll get to be a saint
For ever and ever and ever

27
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:36,000
Forever Amen! Amen! Amen!
