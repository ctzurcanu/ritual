01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:45,000
[roles of: Joan of Arc]

2
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:56,000
[JOAN OF ARC:]
Neither you, la Hire, nor the legions,
Nor the English, nor the Church,

3
01:13:56,000 --> 01:14:02,000
Nor the UN, nor my saved souls,
Nor the priests, nor Google search,

4
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:09,000
Nor redeemed Orléans itself

5
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:23,000
Understand what might is,
Understand what light is,

6
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:37,000
Understand at all,
Understand at all.

7
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:55,000
If you knew all that I knew, my poor France,
You'd see the truth, but you close your eyes.

8
01:14:55,000 --> 01:15:03,000
But you close your eyes.

9
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:20,000
While you crave, your troubles are many, poor France.
To conquer greed, you only have to give.

10
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:35,000
You only have to give.
