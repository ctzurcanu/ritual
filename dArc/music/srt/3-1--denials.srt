1
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:02,160
[FOLLOWERS:] I think I've seen you somewhere

2
01:30:03,700 --> 01:30:05,200
I remember.

3
01:30:05,950 --> 01:30:10,120
You were with that maid they took away

4
01:30:10,500 --> 01:30:13,380
I recognize your face

5
01:30:14,090 --> 01:30:16,590
[CHURCHMAN:] You've got the wrong man, people

6
01:30:17,630 --> 01:30:19,800
I don't know her

7
01:30:20,640 --> 01:30:24,510
And I wasn't where she was

8
01:30:25,970 --> 01:30:27,980
Never near the place

9
01:30:28,480 --> 01:30:32,520
[FOLLOWERS:] That's strange for I am sure
I saw you with her

10
01:30:32,980 --> 01:30:36,780
You were right by her side
and yet you denied

11
01:30:36,900 --> 01:30:40,490
[CHURCHMAN:] I tell you, I was never, ever with her

12
01:30:41,660 --> 01:30:44,660
[FOLLOWERS:] But I saw you, too. He looked just like you.

13
01:30:44,990 --> 01:30:46,200
[CHURCHMAN:] I don't know that Maid!

14
01:30:53,920 --> 01:30:55,630
[JESUS CHRIST:] Churchman,

15
01:30:55,670 --> 01:31:00,010
Don't you know what you have said?

16
01:31:00,680 --> 01:31:03,970
You've gone and cut Christ dead

17
01:31:06,430 --> 01:31:08,270
[CHURCHMAN:] I had to do it

18
01:31:08,560 --> 01:31:11,310
Don't you see?

19
01:31:11,980 --> 01:31:14,650
Or else they'd go for me

20
01:31:17,730 --> 01:31:22,530
[JESUS CHRIST:] It's what she told you
you would do

21
01:31:23,320 --> 01:31:26,740
Do you wonder
how she knew?
