1
01:31:35,830 --> 01:31:37,500
[FOLLOWER:] My God, I saw her

2
01:31:37,580 --> 01:31:41,500
she looked three-quarters dead
and she was so bad, I had to turn my head

3
01:31:41,670 --> 01:31:44,510
You poisoned her
and she was almost broken

4
01:31:44,550 --> 01:31:46,840
And I know who everybody's gonna blame

5
01:31:47,010 --> 01:31:49,220
I don't believe she knows I acted for our good

6
01:31:49,680 --> 01:31:52,390
I'd save her all this suffering if I could

7
01:31:52,470 --> 01:31:55,060
Don't believe our good

8
01:31:57,230 --> 01:32:00,310
And I'd save her if I could

9
01:32:03,190 --> 01:32:06,490
[POLITICIANS:] Cut the confessions, forget the excuses

10
01:32:06,530 --> 01:32:09,990
I don't understand why
you're filled with remorse

11
01:32:10,030 --> 01:32:13,370
All that you've said
has come true with a vengeance

12
01:32:13,450 --> 01:32:16,870
Her followers turned against her
You backed the right horse

13
01:32:16,960 --> 01:32:20,290
What you have done
will be the saving of everyone

14
01:32:20,380 --> 01:32:23,750
You'll be remembered forever for this

15
01:32:23,840 --> 01:32:27,340
And not only that
You've been paid for your efforts

16
01:32:27,380 --> 01:32:30,510
Pretty good wages for one little girl

17
01:32:30,680 --> 01:32:33,890
[FOLLOWER:] Joan, I know you can't hear me

18
01:32:33,970 --> 01:32:37,520
But I only did what your mission needed me to

19
01:32:37,560 --> 01:32:40,900
Joan, I'd sell out the nation

20
01:32:40,980 --> 01:32:44,400
For I have been saddled
with the murder of you

21
01:32:44,480 --> 01:32:47,860
I have been spattered with innocent blood

22
01:32:47,900 --> 01:32:51,280
I shall be dragged
through the slime and the mud

23
01:32:51,370 --> 01:32:54,740
I have been spattered with innocent blood

24
01:32:54,830 --> 01:32:58,160
I shall be dragged
through the slime and the slime and the

25
01:32:58,250 --> 01:33:00,460
Slime and the mud

26
01:33:15,010 --> 01:33:16,350
I

27
01:33:17,640 --> 01:33:21,730
Don't know how to thank her

28
01:33:24,270 --> 01:33:28,690
I don't know why she made me lead

29
01:33:30,280 --> 01:33:31,530
She's a girl

30
01:33:33,620 --> 01:33:35,370
She's just a girl

31
01:33:36,790 --> 01:33:38,540
She is not a Christ

32
01:33:41,120 --> 01:33:42,960
She's just the same

33
01:33:43,630 --> 01:33:47,590
As any other celebrity

34
01:33:49,920 --> 01:33:52,180
She scares me so

35
01:33:55,010 --> 01:33:57,560
While she's scattered ashes

36
01:33:59,980 --> 01:34:02,690
Will she let me free?
Will she forgive

37
01:34:02,770 --> 01:34:04,940
Will she forgive me too?

38
01:34:05,650 --> 01:34:08,150
Does she still care for her Followers?

39
01:34:33,220 --> 01:34:35,010
My mind is

40
01:34:35,430 --> 01:34:36,970
It's in darkness

41
01:34:38,970 --> 01:34:40,180
God.

42
01:34:40,720 --> 01:34:42,020
God, I'm sick!

43
01:34:43,520 --> 01:34:45,400
I've been used!

44
01:34:47,150 --> 01:34:49,730
And you knew all the time!

45
01:34:49,820 --> 01:34:52,360
God! God, I will never know

46
01:34:52,400 --> 01:34:54,860
why you chose me

47
01:34:55,610 --> 01:34:57,370
for your crime!

48
01:34:57,910 --> 01:35:01,620
For your bloody crime!

49
01:35:45,410 --> 01:35:47,580
You have crowned me!

50
01:35:50,290 --> 01:35:52,250
Crowned me!

51
01:35:52,300 --> 01:35:54,590
Crowned me! Elevated me!

52
01:35:54,670 --> 01:35:58,760
Crowned me! Elevated me!
Crowned me, Joan!

53
01:36:02,100 --> 01:36:08,560
[FOLLOWERS:] So long, Follower

54
01:36:09,270 --> 01:36:14,990
Poor old Follower

55
01:36:16,400 --> 01:36:21,950
So long, Follower
