[1805]
[NAPOLEON:] I dreamed I met a maid from France

3
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:08,110
A most inspiring soul

4
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:10,860
She had that look

5
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:13,450
You seldom see

6
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:18,540
The fearless, yet restrained

7
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:22,410
I asked her

8
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,040
what compelled her be

9
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:27,840
How her story begun

10
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,340
I questioned her

11
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:33,930
she said no word

12
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:38,930
As if in other world

13
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:42,520
And next

14
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,730
The room was full

15
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:48,730
of stern and armored men

16
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:53,320
They seemed in awe of her

17
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:56,620
They knelt and then

18
00:05:57,530 --> 00:06:00,120
They vanished once again

19
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,040
Then I saw

20
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:05,920
Then I saw legions upon legions

21
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:08,880
Cheering for this one maid

22
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:11,710
And then I heard them

23
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:14,550
chant my name

24
00:06:14,611 --> 00:06:16,555
As if our fates

25
00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:19,720
were braid

26
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,610
[FOLLOWERS:]  Vive l'Empereur! 

27
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:29,610
[THE POPE:]  Vivat imperator in aeternum! 

28
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:45,530
[1429]
[FOLLOWERS:] Vive Jeanne!
Hey Jeanne, Jeanne, Vive Jeanne!

29
00:06:45,690 --> 00:06:50,620
Hey Jeanne, Vive Jeanne!

30
00:06:51,450 --> 00:06:54,490
Hey Joan, Joan

31
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:57,540
won't you lead us on?

32
00:06:57,580 --> 00:07:02,590
Jeanne, Vive Jeanne!
Vive La Pucelle d'Orléans!

33
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:06,420
[CAUCHON:] Tell your followers to be silent

34
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:08,760
we foresee a threat quite violent

35
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:11,470
This common host

36
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:14,470
has much too boast

37
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:18,350
Tell these fans who sing your praise

38
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:21,610
that they are fools and out of phase

39
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:23,440
They're not on the course

40
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:26,650
the Church will likely endorse

41
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:33,530
[FOLLOWERS:] Vive Jeanne!
Hey Jeanne, Jeanne, Jeanne, Vive Jeanne!

42
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:38,870
Hey Jeanne, Vive Jeanne!

43
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:42,630
Hey Joan, Joan,

44
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:45,460
you're a Saint, or Saint-to-be!

45
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:51,050
Jeanne, Vive Jeanne!
Hey Maid of Orléans!

46
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:56,390
[JOAN:] Why squander your words rebuking my fans?

47
00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:02,150
If you stop their tongues,

48
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:05,230
beware of their hands

49
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,860
If tongues and hands were stilled

50
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:11,360
The sky and land themselves

51
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:15,330
Would start to sing

52
00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:20,750
[FOLLOWERS:] Vive Jeanne!
Hey Jeanne, Jeanne, Jeanne, Vive Jeanne!

53
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:26,000
Hey Jeanne, Vive Jeanne!

54
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:29,920
Hey Joan, Joan,

55
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:33,010
Won't you win for France?

56
00:08:33,050 --> 00:08:38,350
Jeanne, Vive Jeanne, Hey Maid of Orléans!

57
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:43,900
[JOAN:] Sing me your hymns,
But not just for me, do sing.

58
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,730
Sing out for all France,

59
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:49,940
For you are blessed

60
00:08:50,650 --> 00:08:52,610
There is not one here

61
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:55,700
Who cannot win a soul

62
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:58,490
The meek, the brave,

63
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:03,830
The toiling and the giving.

64
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:09,550
[FOLLOWERS:] Vive Jeanne!
Hey Jeanne, Jeanne, Jeanne, Vive Jeanne!

65
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:15,260
Hey Jeanne, Vive Jeanne!

66
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:19,470
Hey Joan, Joan,

67
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:22,520
won't you burn for me?

68
00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:29,070
Jeanne, Vive Jeanne, Hey Maid of Orléans!

69
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:30,780
(ALL CHEERING)

70
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:34,570
[FOLLOWERS:] Joan! Joan! Joan! Joan!

71
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:30,000
[KING CHARLES VII:]

72
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
My mind is clearer now,

73
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:40,000
At last all too well
I can see

74
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
where France
will soon be.

75
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:52,000
If you strip away 
the myth from the maid,

76
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:59,000
You will see where 
we all soon will be.

77
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Joan! You've started to believe
The things they say of you.

78
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:14,000
You really do believe
This voice of Saints is true. Oh!

79
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,000
And all the good you've done
Will soon get swept away.

80
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:27,000
You've begun to matter more
Than voices you obey.

81
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Listen Joan, I don't like what I see.
All I ask is that you listen to me.

82
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Et n'oubliez pas, je suis ton roi!

83
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:51,000
You have kindled their zeitgeist.

84
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
They think they've found another Christ.

85
00:09:54,000 --> 00:11:00,000
And they'll hurt you 
if they'll find they're wrong.

86
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I remember when 
ton histoire began.

87
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,000
No talk of saints then, 
you were une paysanne.

88
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Et crois-moi, 
mon promotion pour toi 
est non encore incinéré.

89
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:23,000
But every word you say today
Gets twisted 'round some other way.

90
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:28,000
And they'll hurt you 
if they think you've lied.

91
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Domrémy, your famous daughter 
should have stayed une anonyme

92
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Like her father tending sheep, 
she'd have made good.

93
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Fields, farms, and rural charms 
would have suited Joan best.

94
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
She'd have caused no alarms; 
nobody would be distressed.

95
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Listen, Joan, do you care for our France?

96
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Bestow to peace a diplomatic chance.

97
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:58,000
We are English-occupied; 
Our logistics are under-supplied.

98
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I am frightened by your clout.
Peasants are getting much too flout.

99
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:14,000
And they'll crush us if they win a war.
If they win any war...

100
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Listen, Joan, to the warning I give.
Please know that I want us to convive.

101
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:43,000
But it's sad to see our bond 
weakening with every city that you bomb.

102
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:49,000
All your followers are blind,
Too much sainthood on their minds.

103
00:12:49,000 --> 00:13:00,000
It was beautiful, but now it's tense.
Yes, it's all gone dangerously tense.

104
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Oh oh oh oh oh 
Yes, it's all gone dangerous.

105
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Listen, Joan, to the warning I give.
Please know that I want you to live.

106
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Allons y,
But she won't listen to me...

107
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Allons y!
She won't listen to me...

108
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:58,640
[FOLLOWERS:] Look at
all my trials and tribulations

109
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:05,270
Sinking in a gentle pool of wine

110
00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:10,240
Don't disturb me now

111
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:14,160
I can see the answers

112
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:18,080
Till this evening is this morning

113
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:21,250
Life is fine

114
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:29,840
Always hoped that I'd be of service

115
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:37,350
Knew that I would earn it if I tried

116
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:42,180
Then when we retire

117
00:14:42,270 --> 00:14:45,940
we can chant of Orléans,

118
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:52,900
So they'll still talk about us et la France

119
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:02,290
[JOAN:] The end...

120
00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:08,460
Is just a little harder

121
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,920
When brought about

122
00:15:14,130 --> 00:15:16,130
By our liege.

123
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:27,650
For all you care

124
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:35,280
your deeds could be my blood.

125
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:43,330
For all you care

126
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:47,500
your gifts to each other

127
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:51,710
could be my body.

128
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:00,850
The end!

129
00:16:01,930 --> 00:16:04,600
It is my blood you act.

130
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:09,520
It is my body you give.

131
00:16:10,810 --> 00:16:15,190
If you would, remember me

132
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:21,370
when you serve and donate

133
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:37,930
I must be mad, thinking I'll be remembered

134
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:40,840
Yes, I must be out of my head!

135
00:16:42,390 --> 00:16:44,470
Look at your blank faces

136
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,640
My name will mean nothing

137
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:48,980
Ten minutes after I'm dead!

138
00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:52,060
The Church denies me

139
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:53,610
One of you betrays me

140
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:56,400
[FOLLOWERS:] No! No!

141
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:59,150
(TALKS INDISTINCTLY) Who would?! Impossible!

142
00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:02,910
[JOAN:] The Church will deny me in just a few days.

143
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:04,790
[THE PRIEST:] No, not me!

144
00:17:04,870 --> 00:17:06,540
[JOAN:] Three times will deny me

145
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:08,580
And that's not all I see

146
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:12,210
One of you here dining
One of France's chosen

147
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:14,000
Will move to betray me

148
00:17:14,090 --> 00:17:17,630
[KING CHARLES VII:] Cut out the dramatics!
You know very well who

149
00:17:17,710 --> 00:17:19,420
[JOAN:] Why don't you go do it?

150
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:21,300
[KING CHARLES VII:] You want me to do it!

151
00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:23,300
[JOAN:] Hurry, the English are waiting

152
00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:25,060
[KING CHARLES VII:] If you knew why I do it

153
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:26,890
[JOAN:] I don't care why you do it!

154
00:17:26,930 --> 00:17:30,390
[KING CHARLES VII:] To think I admired you
Well, now I deny you

155
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:32,350
[JOAN:] You liar, you Judas

156
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:34,150
[KING CHARLES VII:] You wanted me to do it!

157
00:17:34,610 --> 00:17:38,110
What if I man and supply you again?
and ruined your ambition?

158
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:39,610
Christ, you deserve it!

159
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:42,280
[JOAN:] Hurry, you fool
Hurry and go

160
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:45,530
Save me your speeches
I don't want to know

161
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:48,500
Go! Go!

162
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:54,210
[FOLLOWERS:] Look at all my trials
and tribulations

163
00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:59,880
Sinking in a gentle pool of wine

164
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:03,220
What's that in the bread

165
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:06,010
It's gone to my head

166
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:09,220
Till this morning is this evening

167
00:18:09,310 --> 00:18:11,560
Life is fine

168
00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:18,480
Always hoped that I'd be of service.

169
00:18:19,150 --> 00:18:24,450
Knew that I would earn it if I tried.

170
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:27,580
Then when we retire

171
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:30,540
we can chant of Orléans,

172
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:36,670
So they'll all talk
about us et la France.

173
00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:49,560
[KING CHARLES VII:] You sad, pathetic maid

174
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:51,640
see what you make me do,

175
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:54,020
We lost city of Paris

176
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:56,360
and all because of you

177
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:58,730
But the unkingly part of all

178
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:01,150
I need to turn you i

179
00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:03,320
Like a common criminal

180
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:05,860
Like the traitor you could be

181
00:19:05,910 --> 00:19:07,820
A Retired Victor

182
00:19:07,870 --> 00:19:09,870
A Victor baddly tired

183
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:14,040
Like a retired, tired, tired and retired, chef de guerre à la retraite

184
00:19:14,210 --> 00:19:16,710
[JOAN:] Get out! They're waiting!

185
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:19,250
Get out!

186
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,510
They're waiting! Oh!

187
00:19:21,550 --> 00:19:23,550
English are waiting for you!

188
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:26,220
[KING CHARLES VII:] Every time I look at you

189
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:29,180
I don't understand

190
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:34,310
Why you let the things
you did get so out of hand

191
00:19:34,810 --> 00:19:37,350
You'd have managed better

192
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:40,360
if you'd follow what I planned

193
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,070
Oh

194
00:19:58,290 --> 00:20:03,630
[FOLLOWERS:] Always hoped that I'd be of service.

195
00:20:05,670 --> 00:20:10,180
Knew that I would earn it if I tried.

196
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:12,260
If I tried

197
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:19,440
Then when we retire, we can chant of Orléans,

198
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:23,940
So they'll still talk about us

199
00:20:24,610 --> 00:20:29,200
et la France.

200
00:20:32,870 --> 00:20:37,040
[JOAN:] Will no one pray with me?

201
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,130
Soldiers?

202
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,250
Priests?

203
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,050
Frenchmen?

204
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:49,970
Will none of you burn with me?

205
00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:53,810
Soldiers?

206
00:20:55,470 --> 00:20:56,770
Priests?

207
00:20:57,810 --> 00:20:59,520
Frenchmen?

208
00:21:21,639 --> 00:21:28,460
[JOAN:] I only wish to say,

209
00:21:28,639 --> 00:21:32,460
If there’s a way,

210
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Keep the flames away from me,
For I am weaker than this torment.

211
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Feel it burn me,
I have changed.

212
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Once I heard voices, clear and sparkling.

213
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Then, I was chosen.
Now, I’m trapped and poisoned.

214
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Listen, surely I've met 
Heaven's expectations,

215
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Fought one long year, 
seemed like twenty.

216
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Has Jesus asked as much 
from any other soul?

217
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:39,000
But if I burn,
See my path through

218
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,000
and keep my standard true,

219
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Let them mock me, 
scorn me, chain me,

220
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,000
stake me to the flames.

221
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
I want to know, 
I want to know, dear Jesus,

222
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Want to know, 
I want to know, good Jesus,

223
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Want to see, 
I want to see, dear Saints,

224
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Want to see, 
I want to see, dear Saints,

225
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Why I must burn.

226
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Will my name shine brighter 
than it ever has before?

227
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Will all the hearts I moved 
beat same drum evermore?

228
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,000
I need to know, 
I need to know, dear Jesus,

229
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Need to know, 
I need to know, good Jesus,

230
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Need to see, 
I need to see, dear Saints,

231
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Need to see, 
I need to see, good Saints,

232
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:35,000
If I am ash 
what will then be my crown?

233
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
If I am ash 
what will then be my crown?

234
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Need to know, 
I need to know, dear Jesus,

235
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
I need to know, 
I need to know, good Jesus,

236
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,000
I need to know, 
I need to know, my God,

237
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Why must I burn? 
Oh, 
why must I burn?

238
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Can you tell me now 
my dust won't be forgotten?

239
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Show me just a fragment 
of your grand celestial plane.

240
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Show me there's a reason 
for my toils and pain.

241
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:19,000
You've chosen me for grilling 
and tasked Rouen for embers.

242
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Alright, 
I'll burn!

243
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Oh oh oh Just
Just watch me burn!

244
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:39,000
See
See how I burn!
Oh oh oh oh

245
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Yeah
See how I burn!

246
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Back then I was chosen,

247
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Now, I'm trapped and poisoned.

248
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:41,000
After all, 
I've tried for one year, 
seems like always.

249
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Angel Michael, for The Throne, 
your white standard I've flown

250
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:58,000
In Rouen's fiery dawn, 
I'll burn for Christ, 
alone.

251
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Heaven, your purpose is vast,

252
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:13,000
But in you, my trust is cast.

253
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:21,000
I'll wear your garb, 
accept my past.

254
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Take me to your stake, 
Rouen.

255
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Burn me, light me,
End me.

256
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Take me, now!

257
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:43,000
Before my heart gives up.

258
00:27:03,450 --> 00:27:08,330
[CAUCHON:] We've been sitting on
the fence for far too long

259
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:13,710
[D'ESTIVET:] Why let her upset us?

260
00:27:14,290 --> 00:27:16,300
Cauchon, let her be

261
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:19,170
All those imbeciles will see

262
00:27:20,050 --> 00:27:21,630
She really doesn't matter

263
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,640
[CAUCHON:] Joan is important,

264
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,770
We've let her go her way before.

265
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:30,640
And while she starts the revolution

266
00:27:31,230 --> 00:27:33,310
We theorize and chatter

267
00:27:34,190 --> 00:27:39,780
[D'ESTIVET:] He's just another
scripture-thumping hack from Lorraine

268
00:27:40,570 --> 00:27:43,200
[CAUCHON:] The difference is they call her a Saint

269
00:27:43,530 --> 00:27:45,740
This difference frightens me!

270
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:47,490
What about the Church?

271
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:50,960
When they see a new Maid crowned,

272
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:54,040
Do you think they'll stand around

273
00:27:54,170 --> 00:27:56,500
Cheering and applauding?

274
00:27:57,340 --> 00:27:59,050
What about our cardinals?

275
00:28:00,130 --> 00:28:02,340
If they see we've lost our nerve

276
00:28:03,090 --> 00:28:05,510
Don't you think that they deserve

277
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:07,930
Something less challenging?

278
00:28:10,310 --> 00:28:12,690
[D'ESTIVET:] But followers got what they want

279
00:28:12,770 --> 00:28:15,690
They think so anyway

280
00:28:17,150 --> 00:28:19,690
If she's what they want

281
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:22,110
Why take their toy away?

282
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:25,360
She's a craze

283
00:28:25,910 --> 00:28:27,990
[CAUCHON:] Put yourself in my place

284
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:30,250
I can hardly step aside

285
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,160
Cannot let my hands be tied

286
00:28:33,790 --> 00:28:35,630
I am canon law and order

287
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:38,290
What about our priesthood?

288
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:41,260
Don't you see that we could fall

289
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:44,300
If we are to last at all?

290
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:46,760
We cannot be divided

291
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,390
[D'ESTIVET:] Then say so to the Clerics

292
00:28:50,010 --> 00:28:52,430
But don't rely on subtlety

293
00:28:53,230 --> 00:28:55,770
Let English scare them or they won't see

294
00:28:56,230 --> 00:28:58,190
[CAUCHON:] Then we are decided?

295
00:28:59,650 --> 00:29:01,570
[D'ESTIVET:] Then we are decided.

296
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:41,020
[CHARLES VII:] Now if I help you,
it matters that you see

297
00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:43,480
These sordid kind of things
are coming hard to me

298
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:46,400
It's taken me some time
to work out what to do

299
00:29:46,490 --> 00:29:48,990
I weighed the whole thing out
before I came to you

300
00:29:49,070 --> 00:29:51,660
I have no thought at all about my own reward

301
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:54,120
I really didn't come here of my own accord

302
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:57,370
Just don't say I'm

303
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:02,500
Damned for all time!

304
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:07,380
I came because I had to
I'm the one who saw

305
00:30:07,930 --> 00:30:10,300
Joan can't control it like she did before

306
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:12,850
And furthermore
I know that Joan thinks so too

307
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:15,770
Joan wouldn't mind that I was here with you

308
00:30:15,850 --> 00:30:18,440
I have no thought at all about my own reward

309
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:21,270
I really didn't come here of my own accord

310
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:23,940
Just don't say I'm

311
00:30:26,650 --> 00:30:29,320
Damned for all time!

312
00:30:37,370 --> 00:30:40,000
Burgundians, you're friends, worldly men and wise

313
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:42,460
Cauchon, my friend I know you sympathize

314
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:45,090
Why are we the prophets?
Why are we the ones?

315
00:30:45,170 --> 00:30:47,550
We see the sad solution
Know what must be done

316
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:50,390
I have no thought at all about my own reward

317
00:30:50,430 --> 00:30:53,140
I really didn't come here of my own accord

318
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:55,430
Just don't say I'm

319
00:30:55,810 --> 00:30:58,230
Damned

320
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:02,560
For all time!

321
00:31:03,730 --> 00:31:05,480
[BURGUNDIANS:] Cut the protesting

322
00:31:05,570 --> 00:31:07,440
Forget the excuses

323
00:31:07,530 --> 00:31:09,240
We want information

324
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:10,820
Get up off the floor

325
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:12,740
[CAUCHON:] We have the papers

326
00:31:12,780 --> 00:31:14,490
We need to arrest her

327
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:16,330
You know her movements

328
00:31:16,410 --> 00:31:17,910
We know the canon law

329
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,830
[BURGUNDIANS:] Your help in this matter
won't go unrewarded

330
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:25,170
[CAUCHON:] We'll pay you in silver cash on the nail

331
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:29,260
We just need to know
where the soldiers can find her

332
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:30,760
[BURGUNDIANS:] With no armies around her

333
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:32,140
Then we can't fail

334
00:31:32,470 --> 00:31:35,680
[CHARLES VII:] I don't want your blood money

335
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:39,730
[CAUCHON:] That doesn't matter,
our expenses are good

336
00:31:39,770 --> 00:31:42,770
[CHARLES VII:] I don't need your blood money

337
00:31:42,850 --> 00:31:46,440
[BURGUNDIANS:] But you might as well take it
We think that you should

338
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:50,450
[CAUCHON:] Think of the things
you can do with that money

339
00:31:50,490 --> 00:31:53,910
Choose any charity, give to the poor

340
00:31:53,950 --> 00:31:57,450
We've noted your motives
We've noted your feelings

341
00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:59,790
[CAUCHON:] This isn't blood money, it's a...

342
00:31:59,870 --> 00:32:00,910
[BURGUNDIANS:] A fee.

343
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:04,500
[CAUCHON:] A fee, nothing more

344
00:32:36,910 --> 00:32:40,580
[CHARLES VII:] On Tuesday morning

345
00:32:41,370 --> 00:32:46,040
You'll find her where you want her

346
00:32:50,170 --> 00:32:54,130
Far from her army

347
00:32:55,050 --> 00:32:59,180
tired, locked out of gates

348
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:02,730
(MUMBLES)

349
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:06,900
of Compiégne

350
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:12,240
[BURGUNDIANS:] Well done Sire

351
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:18,320
Good old Charles

352
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:38,010
[JOAN:] Sire,

353
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:41,260

00:46:34,130 --> 00:46:38,510
There will be mad kings
always in power

530
00:46:38,550 --> 00:46:41,850
Look at the good things you've got!

531
00:46:42,850 --> 00:46:44,940
Think while you still have France

532
00:46:45,020 --> 00:46:47,520
Move while you still rule France

533
00:46:48,230 --> 00:46:51,570
You'll be lost and you'll be sad

534
00:46:52,570 --> 00:46:57,660
without a kingdom.

535
00:46:57,910 --> 00:47:00,240
[JESUS:] Sleep and I shall soothe you

536
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:02,450
Calm you and anoint you

537
00:47:02,540 --> 00:47:05,580
Myrrh for your hot forehead

538
00:47:05,620 --> 00:47:08,920
Then you'll feel everything's all right, yes

539
00:47:09,250 --> 00:47:11,050
Everything's fine

540
00:47:11,090 --> 00:47:15,090
And it's cool and the ointment's sweet

541
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:19,220
For the fire in your head and feet

542
00:47:19,720 --> 00:47:22,890
Close your eyes
Close your eyes and relax

543
00:47:22,930 --> 00:47:24,430
Think of light

544
00:47:24,560 --> 00:47:25,560
Tonight

545
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:27,230
[FOLLOWERS:] Close your eyes, close your eyes and relax

546
00:47:27,270 --> 00:47:28,400
Think of light

547
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:30,980
[JESUS:] Close your eyes, close your eyes and relax

558
00:48:11,230 --> 00:48:15,610
[JESUS:] Close your eyes, close your eyes and relax
[FOLLOWERS:] Everything's a light, yes

559
00:48:15,650 --> 00:48:17,860
Close your eyes, close your eyes and relax
Everything's all light, yes

560
00:48:17,860 --> 00:48:22,410
Everything's PURE LIGHT, yes

561
00:48:37,130 --> 00:48:40,010
[KING CHARLES VII:] It seems to me a strange thing

562
00:48:41,260 --> 00:48:43,140
Mystifying

563
00:48:43,850 --> 00:48:47,810
That a Christ like you bestows his light

564
00:48:48,560 --> 00:48:50,890
On a lowly paysanne like her

565
00:48:51,480 --> 00:48:53,150
[LA HIRE] Hey, cool it, king.

566
00:48:53,690 --> 00:48:56,400
[KING CHARLES VII:] Yes, I can understand that

567
00:48:56,900 --> 00:48:59,740
She is a hero

568
00:49:00,190 --> 00:49:04,490
But to let her hear you and your saints

569
00:49:04,990 --> 00:49:07,540
That's hardly in your line

570
00:49:08,040 --> 00:49:11,330
It's not that I object to her toils

571
00:49:12,710 --> 00:49:16,340
But she doesn't fit in well
with what your Church teaches

572
00:49:16,380 --> 00:49:19,840
It doesn't help us if the Church is inconsistent

573
00:49:20,590 --> 00:49:22,880
The English only need a small excuse

574
00:49:23,180 --> 00:49:24,840
To make all world theirs

575
00:49:25,550 --> 00:49:27,890
[JESUS CHRIST:] Who are you to criticize her?

576
00:49:27,970 --> 00:49:30,020
Who are you to despise her?

577
00:49:30,060 --> 00:49:32,020
Leave her, leave her
Let her be now

578
00:49:32,060 --> 00:49:34,270
Leave her, leave her
She's with me now

579
00:49:34,350 --> 00:49:37,520
If your slate is clean
then you can throw stones

580
00:49:37,610 --> 00:49:40,940
If your slate is not, then leave her alone!

581
00:49:45,700 --> 00:49:46,990
[FOLLOWERS:] Hey, Jesus, what do we say?

582
00:49:47,030 --> 00:49:48,950
-Hey, Jesus, what do we say?
-(CLAMORING)

583
00:49:56,170 --> 00:49:58,460
[JESUS CHRIST:] I'm amazed that you influencers

584
00:49:58,540 --> 00:50:01,380
Can be so shallow, thick and slow

585
00:50:01,420 --> 00:50:05,260
There is not a soul among you
who knows or cares where I come or go

586

No, you're wrong
You're very wrong

No, you're wrong
You're very wrong

590
00:50:14,940 --> 00:50:16,560
How can you say that?

591
00:50:16,600 --> 00:50:18,270
How can you say that?

592
00:50:18,360 --> 00:50:19,730
How can you say that?

593
00:50:20,070 --> 00:50:21,900
How can you say that?

594
00:50:22,190 --> 00:50:23,240
[JESUS CHRIST:] Not one.

595
00:50:23,650 --> 00:50:25,280
[JESUS CHRIST:] Not one of you!

Don't you mind about the future

603
00:50:46,680 --> 00:50:49,510
Don't you try to think ahead

604
00:50:51,010 --> 00:50:53,480
Save tomorrow for tomorrow

605
00:50:55,230 --> 00:50:56,690

Who is this spectral form?

[FOLLOWER:] It's Joan of Arc,
Queen of France.

655

[NAPOLEON:] Ah.

656
00:53:52,300 --> 00:53:54,300
So this is Joan of Arc.

657
00:53:54,970 --> 00:53:57,850
I've read about your spark.

00:53:57,930 --> 00:53:59,810
You look so small.

659
00:54:00,680 --> 00:54:02,640
Unfit for a war.

00:54:04,100 --> 00:54:06,610
I've heard your tale of woes,

Be so cool about her fate?

Operate the change of fate; 

702
00:56:12,620 --> 00:56:14,740
anoint yourself a saint

703
00:56:14,780 --> 00:56:16,490
Perform this small feat

704
00:56:16,580 --> 00:56:18,910
make all skeptics retreat

705
00:56:20,040 --> 00:56:22,920
Come on, Supermaiden

706
00:56:24,250 --> 00:56:28,670
Joan, you can't conceive 
the stir you've made in Rome

707
00:56:29,260 --> 00:56:33,050
You're on everyone's lips, 
from pauper to the dome

708
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:34,640
Oh

709
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:38,060
What a tale if it turns out false, my dear

710
00:56:38,390 --> 00:56:43,060
But I believe 
you could sway the critics, have no fear

711
00:56:43,980 --> 00:56:45,980
So, you are the Maid, 

712
00:56:46,070 --> 00:56:48,610
you're Church's SuperMaid.

713
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:51,820
Show to me you're Heaven's tool; 

714
00:56:51,860 --> 00:56:53,620
walk unburned through fiery fuel

715
00:56:53,820 --> 00:56:55,490
-If you pass through the flame,
-CROWD: Whoo!

716
00:56:55,580 --> 00:56:58,330
-holy I will make your name
-CROWD: Whoo!

717
00:56:58,830 --> 00:57:01,960
Come on, Maid of Orléans

718
00:57:21,850 --> 00:57:25,810
I ask you as I would of any saint-to-be

719
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:30,320
What gift from God was placed on you 
where all the world can see?

720
00:57:30,360 --> 00:57:31,530
Oh-oh-oh

721
00:57:31,570 --> 00:57:32,860
I am waiting

722
00:57:32,950 --> 00:57:35,200
as the Church's guiding hand

723
00:57:35,370 --> 00:57:39,540
Awaiting proof that you're apart 
from those in the normy band

724
00:57:41,620 --> 00:57:43,040
So, if you are the Maid

725
00:57:43,120 --> 00:57:45,670
the proclaimed Saint Joan

726
00:57:46,210 --> 00:57:48,630
Fill the github with your deeds

727
00:57:48,710 --> 00:57:50,380
heal world hunger and all needs

728
00:57:51,420 --> 00:57:55,300
Or are tales all gone wrong? 
Joan, why make us wait so long?

729
00:57:55,800 --> 00:57:58,720
Oh! Come on, you Supermaiden

730
00:58:00,100 --> 00:58:03,020
(SINGING)  Hey! Doesn't

731
00:58:03,060 --> 00:58:05,730
Church Triumphant scare you, Joan?

732
00:58:05,770 --> 00:58:09,520
Oh, Venerable Joan of Arc?

733
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:15,410
You're a trademark, not a saint.
Proof is what we want, not quaint.

734
00:58:15,490 --> 00:58:16,950
(SINGS)  Keep her away,

735
00:58:17,030 --> 00:58:19,580
Next audience: next century!

736
00:58:20,450 --> 00:58:22,450
Speak no more, Joan of,

737
00:58:22,750 --> 00:58:24,410
Silence, Joan of,

738
00:58:25,250 --> 00:58:27,710
Quiet, you Venerable Blessed Saint Joan of Arc!

739
00:58:29,420 --> 00:58:32,050
THE POPE: Leave our records!

740
00:58:33,420 --> 00:58:34,760
Your standard leads nowhere, Joan,

741
00:58:35,590 --> 00:58:37,680
Erase her from our archives!

742
00:58:32,790 --> 00:58:35,250
[NAPOLEON:] And so the Queen

743
00:58:36,290 --> 00:58:39,090
Is once again my guest

744
00:58:40,250 --> 00:58:42,000
And why is this?

745
00:58:43,090 --> 00:58:45,840
Was The Pope unimpressed?

746
00:58:46,840 --> 00:58:49,180
[CAUCHON:] We turn to history

747
00:58:49,890 --> 00:58:52,390
To seal our judgement

748
00:58:54,140 --> 00:58:56,810
We have no way

749
00:58:57,650 --> 00:59:00,480
To pain her after death

750
00:59:03,650 --> 00:59:06,650
We need her totally forgotten

751
00:59:06,740 --> 00:59:09,320
It's all you have to do

752
00:59:09,820 --> 00:59:11,990
We need her erased from history

753
00:59:12,030 --> 00:59:14,660
It's all you have to do

754
00:59:15,830 --> 00:59:19,580
[NAPOLEON:] Talk to me, Joan of Arc
You have been brought here

755
00:59:19,670 --> 00:59:23,000
Manacled, burned, by your own people.

756
00:59:23,090 --> 00:59:26,050
Do you have the first idea
why you deserved it?

757
00:59:26,420 --> 00:59:30,010
[NAPOLEON:] Listen Savioress of France,
Where are your saved?

758
00:59:30,090 --> 00:59:32,640
Look at me
Am I saved?

759
00:59:33,140 --> 00:59:35,140
[JOAN:] I have no savings

760
00:59:35,680 --> 00:59:37,690
In the world, I'm through.

761
00:59:38,350 --> 00:59:39,650
[FOLLOWERS:] Talk to me, Joan of Arc

762
00:59:39,690 --> 00:59:43,320
[JOAN:] There may be something saved for me somewhere.

763
00:59:43,690 --> 00:59:45,530
If you only knew.

764
00:59:47,200 --> 00:59:48,650
[NAPOLEON:] Then you are a savioress?

765
00:59:48,700 --> 00:59:50,070
[JOAN:] It's you who say I am

766
00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:53,080
I look for truth and find that I get grilled

767
00:59:53,160 --> 00:59:55,910
[NAPOLEON:] And what is truth?
Is truth unchanging law?

768
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,710
We both have truths
Are mine the same as yours?

769
00:59:58,750 --> 01:00:01,040
[FOLLOWERS:] Forget of her! Erase her deeds!

770
01:00:01,130 --> 01:00:04,000
[NAPOLEON:] What do you mean? You'd forget your savioress?

771
01:00:04,050 --> 01:00:06,010
[FOLLOWERS:] We have no savior but our own selves!

772
01:00:06,050 --> 01:00:08,970
[NAPOLEON:] She's done no wrong.
No, not the slightest thing.

773
01:00:09,180 --> 01:00:10,840
[FOLLOWERS:] We have no savior but our own selves!

774
01:00:10,890 --> 01:00:11,970
Erase her!

775
01:00:12,050 --> 01:00:15,060
[NAPOLEON:] What is this new respect for self?

776
01:00:15,100 --> 01:00:17,560
This looks imported from New Orleans.

777
01:00:17,640 --> 01:00:20,560
Who is this Saint? Why is she different?

778
01:00:20,770 --> 01:00:23,400
You choose bad leaders by the sackful.

779
01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:27,780
[FOLLOWERS:] We need her edited out,
It's all you have to do

780
01:00:27,860 --> 01:00:31,990
We need her erased,
It's all you have to do

781
01:00:32,740 --> 01:00:35,700
[NAPOLEON:] Talk to me, Joan of Arc

782
01:00:46,050 --> 01:00:48,380
Look at your Joan of Arc

783
01:00:48,420 --> 01:00:50,340
I'll agree she's mad

784
01:00:50,840 --> 01:00:52,760
Ought to be re-trialed

785
01:00:52,840 --> 01:00:55,560
But that is not a reason to erase her

786
01:00:56,260 --> 01:01:00,270
She's a sad, little girl, not a Savior or Christ

787
01:01:00,810 --> 01:01:03,650
Not even a liar, I need a crime!

788
01:01:03,730 --> 01:01:07,690

you hate US more than her

Erase her!

[NAPOLEON:] I see no reason, I find no evil

796
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,670
This girl is harmless
so why does she upset you?

797
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:32,470
She's just misguided, thinks she's important

798
01:01:32,510 --> 01:01:35,680
But to keep you vultures happy,
I shall edit her!

Will you touch, will you mend me, Joan?

1068
01:20:16,400 --> 01:20:18,240
There's too little of me.

1069
01:20:18,490 --> 01:20:19,860
Will you kiss, you can like me, Joan

1070
01:20:19,900 --> 01:20:21,860
Don't crowd me!

1071
01:20:22,280 --> 01:20:23,910

01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:07,000
[JESUS CHRIST:] I've been waiting to see you.

1078
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:14,000
You've been burning to see me,
but it shouldn't be like this.

1079
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:20,000

1080
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:25,000
Ready for Joan of Arc Romee, anew?

1081
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:32,000
You are my only hope.

1082
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:36,000
Papalis Infallibilitas too much.

1083
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:39,000
Now for the first time,
I think The Pope was wrong.

1084
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:42,000
Awake him ex cathedra,

1085
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,000
Make his judgement pro tempore.

1086
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:51,000

[THE POPE:] I think you've made your point now.

1088
01:21:56,000 --> 01:22:02,000
You've even gone a bit too far to get the message home.

Before it gets too far,

1090
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:07,000

you did get so out of hand

1109
01:24:19,680 --> 01:24:23,270
You'd have managed better
if I'd had you planned

1110
01:24:23,350 --> 01:24:27,230

such a backward time in such a strange land?

You've been paid for your efforts

01:33:15,010 --> 01:33:16,350
I

1227
01:33:17,640 --> 01:33:21,730
Don't know how to thank her

1228
01:33:24,270 --> 01:33:28,690
I don't know why she made me lead

1229
01:33:30,280 --> 01:33:31,530
She's a girl

1230
01:33:33,620 --> 01:33:35,370
She's just a girl

1231
01:33:36,790 --> 01:33:38,540
She is not a Christ

1232
01:33:41,120 --> 01:33:42,960
She's just the same

1233
01:33:43,630 --> 01:33:47,590
As any other celebrity

1234
01:33:49,920 --> 01:33:52,180
She scares me so

1235
01:33:55,010 --> 01:33:57,560
While she's scattered ashes

1236
01:33:59,980 --> 01:34:02,690
Will she let me free?
Will she forgive

1237
01:34:02,770 --> 01:34:04,940
Will she forgive me too?

1238
01:34:05,650 --> 01:34:08,150
Does she still care for her Followers?

1239
01:34:33,220 --> 01:34:35,010
My mind is

1240
01:34:35,430 --> 01:34:36,970
It's in darkness

1241
01:34:38,970 --> 01:34:40,180
God.

1242
01:34:40,720 --> 01:34:42,020
God, I'm sick!

1243
01:34:43,520 --> 01:34:45,400
I've been used!

1244
01:34:47,150 --> 01:34:49,730
And you knew all the time!

1245
01:34:49,820 --> 01:34:52,360
God! God, I will never know

1246
01:34:52,400 --> 01:34:54,860
why you chose me

1247
01:34:55,610 --> 01:34:57,370
for your crime!

1248
01:34:57,910 --> 01:35:01,620
For your bloody crime!

1249
01:35:45,410 --> 01:35:47,580
You have crowned me!

1250
01:35:50,290 --> 01:35:52,250
Crowned me!

1251
01:35:52,300 --> 01:35:54,590
Crowned me! Elevated me!

1252
01:35:54,670 --> 01:35:58,760
Crowned me! Elevated me!
Crowned me, Joan!

1253
01:36:02,100 --> 01:36:08,560

1254
01:36:09,270 --> 01:36:14,990
