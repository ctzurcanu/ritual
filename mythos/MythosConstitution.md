  - two or more proofs (already accepted by the Proof Market)
  - any combination of references (created by the Executive), truths and proofs
- a mathematical or rational demonstration
55. The Proof Market elects its own officers and may or may not accept officers elected for it by the Truth Market.
56. It also regulates the Truth Market by overruling its decisions in the case of (the values of X and Y are established by the Proof Market):
- An issue is overturned more than X number of times
- An issue is overturned twice but it locked more than Y MYT


## Executive

- on-chain: automated by the Mythos chain contracts
- off-chain: as duties of the Mythos offices

## Justice

86. Participation in on-chain justice is optional: the cases will be forwarded to the respective lawful jurisdictions if any of the parties is not satisfied.
87. If a case that originates on-chain has a legal solution off-chain, Mythos will fully accept the solution.
