|  **Dimensions** | **Human Body** | **Temple's Menorah** |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  Anatomical location | Head | Head of God <br>Nourishment-ingesting organ |
|  Main nourishing gate | Lips | Middle Lamp |
|  Secondary nourishing gates | Nostrils | 2 Lamps adjacent to the middle |
|  Tertiary nourishing gates | Lower lacrimal ducts | 2 Lamps distally-adjacent to the previous |

|  Flow | The buccal cavity, nostrils, <br>lacrimal ducts flow into the esophagus | The arms are attached to the middle arm |
|  Dimensional folding 1 | From multiple ducts into 1 duct | From multiple arms into 1 arm |
|  Dimensional folding 2 |  | From 1 arm to 1 point |
