### Process

#### Breath Cycle

Air is inspired though the nostrils, passes through sinuses, pharynx, trachea, bronchi, bronchioles, and arrives into the alveoli. There the O2 is received into the blood and CO2 is released into the alveolar air. Then the alveolar air is expired through the same route. Preferably though the mouth instead of the nostrils.
The O2-rich blood from the lungs arrives at the heart and transports the O2 to heart, lungs, etc. through their respective vascularizations. There it becomes O2-poor and CO2-rich. It returns to the heart only to be pumped into the pulmonary circulation to repeat the cycle.


#### Year Cycle

Once a year, on Yom Kippur, the pure men enter the Temple. Those who breathe through the right nostril enter by the opening between the Temple wall and Boaz. Those who breathe through the left nostril enter by the symmetric opening by Jachin.
They arrive into the porch (Ulam) and proceed into the Holy Place (Hekhal). Those who entered by Boaz stay to the right and those who entered by Jachin stay to the left.
Only the High Priest passes through the veil and the doors to the Holy of Holies (Kodesh haKodashim) and deposits a blood sacrifice on the Ark of Covenant on the Mercy Seat (kapporet).
After receiving the blessing of God, the High Priest returns to the Holy Place and shares what he has received for the attendance.
The attendance exist through the opening between Boaz and Jachin. And the ritual repeats next year.

## Hypotheses
- Women should have been allowed into the Holy Place while not menstruating because men do not fully understand the passive energy symbolized by Jachin.
- In order to visit both sides of the Holy Place, men could change their breath on the left nostril before entering the Temple again.
- Changing sides while inside the Temple does not favour discrimination, but favours harmony. Such air exchange techniques are present in Thrul Khor exercises and other secret schools. To note: such exercises cannot be done for the sinuses (organs of ajna/discrimination), therefore not recommended to be done for the lungs unless there is an exact reason/motive.
